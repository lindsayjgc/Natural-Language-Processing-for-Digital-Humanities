And I declare that the house where I am, which

faces west, and an old (house), the inheritance of my

child Agustín Vázquez, and my new (house?) I give to

my grandchild Baltasar Vázquez, and the whole house

lot will belong to my grandchild. And to my son I give

the house which was his father's. I assign it to him with

the land on which it stands.

- And a small house which faces toward the east I give to

Martín Cano. He is to take the stone.

- And I declare that there is cloth on a loom for a huipil,

and rabbit fur; it is to be sold, and with the proceeds

masses will be said for me. And a jícara for washing

hands is to be sold.

- And I give my child and grandchild one each of the two

chests.

- This is all the statement that the invalid made. It was

done before the lord don Juan Ramírez, Mateo ..., Martín

Cano, and Lorenzo López, and they set down their

(signatures).

Don Juan Ramírez. Lorenzo López.

And I, Alonso Dávila de Santiago, notary here in

Culhuacan, say that this testament is good and true, and I

wrote it, wherefore I place here my name and signature.
