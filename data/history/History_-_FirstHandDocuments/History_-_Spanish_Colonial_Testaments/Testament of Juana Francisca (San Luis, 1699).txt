Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

Today, Monday the [3rd] of the month of January in this year of 1699, I named Juana Francisca in the tlaxilacalli of San Luis record this little memorandum [of testament] of mine; my husband's name is Miguel de la Cruz. I say truly before God that I have nothing, wherefore it appears here on paper.

And I say that a mass is to be said for me, to be the help of my soul and spirit. I say truly before God that I leave to a daughter of mine named Ana Maria a cultivated field, and I say that likewise to that daughter of mine named Ana Maria I leave a wooden vessel; I leave it to her. And I leave to my daughter named Ana Maria a lot with small magueyes.

That is all that I have said before God and my witnesses, Luis Manuel and Juan de la Cruz, and the fiscal mayor, Pablo Fabela.

Notary: Bartolomé González
