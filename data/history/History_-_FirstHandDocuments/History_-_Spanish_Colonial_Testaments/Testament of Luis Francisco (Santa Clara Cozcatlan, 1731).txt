May the precious revered name of God the father, God his precious son, and God the Holy Spirit be entirely praised. May it be done, amen. Jesus. Today, Monday the 27th day of the month of August, in the year count 1731, I Luis Francisco, married to Cristina Ana, in my tlaxilacalli of Santa Clara, begin my testament. I am very ill; I say that if I die in the future, first of all I place my spirit and soul entirely in the hands of my precious revered father God; may he come to take it, for it was made by him. And my earthly body I assign to the earth, for from it it came and of it it was made. And I say that my grave is to be at the great church, behind the holy cross, where my precious father is buried; there my earthly body is to lie buried when my precious revered father God has summoned me. And half a real is to be given as an offering for Holy Jerusalem. And I say that the help of my soul is to be a high mass to be performed for me. And I say that I have three little children, one named Francisco Javier, another named Alberta Maria, another named Gregoria Luisa. I leave them here with my precious mother Isabel Maria, who is to raise them. And if my precious mother dies in the future, she is to leave to my child Francisco Javier the house, [of which] one [building] stands looking west and the other south, [and also] the land that goes with it. There he is to serve our lord God. And I say that I greatly implore Pedro de Santiago to be my executor and speak for me. And as I have made my testament witnesses were summoned: Pedro Martin; don Matías Andrés; and Lorenzo Hipólito. And I say that in Huitzillan a person named Manuel de los Santos owes me a new jacket [in mixed style]. I hocked it for a real: it is to be collected. 

Bernardo de Santiago, notary.
