Miguel Sánchez Tlacatecuhtli of Santa María

Asunción Amantlan

- In the name of our lord Jesus Christ and of his precious

mother, the heavenly lady Holy Mary, eternally virgin,

know all who see this document that I, Miguel Sánchez

Tlacatecuhtli, whose home is here in Culhuacan in the

ward of Amantlan, even though I am sick, nonetheless

my spirit and understanding are healthy. I truly believe

in our lord Jesus Christ, and for this reason with invoca-

tion and supplication to him I make my testament and

will.

- First I declare that I am giving my spirit and soul to

God our lord because he made it and came to redeem it

here on earth. And my body I give to the earth because

from earth it came.

- And I declare that I have two houses, where I used to

be, which face east, with their houselot of 20 (units of

measure) on all sides. And I give all of it to my child

Gerónimo Chachalaca.

- And I have a purchased house which stands in Tian-

quiztenco (beside the marketplace?). I gave (paid) three

pesos to my older sister María for it. It is just the house,

without its land. And I give it to my child Gerónimo

Chachalaca.

- Also there are 10 chinampas of mine in Quaxochtenco.

And I give them to my child Gerónimo.

- And there is a chinampa of mine in Tlacatecco of 40

(units) in length, next to the field of Gabriel de San

Francisco. And I give it to my child Gerónimo.

- And there are three chinampas of mine, of three (rows)

each, in Atlimopilohuayan (where there is a cascade).

And I give them to my niece Petronilla.
