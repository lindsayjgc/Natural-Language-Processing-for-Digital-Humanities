May the precious revered name of God the father, God his precious son, and God the Holy Spirit be entirely praised. May it be done, amen. Jesus.

Today Monday the 23rd day of the month of November in the year count of 1733, I María de la Encarnación, widow of Mateo de la Cruz, make my memorandum [of testament] in my tlaxilacalli of San Juan Evangelista. I say that if I die in the future, first of all I place my spirit and soul very entirely in the hands of my precious revered father God; may he come take it, for it was made by him. As for my earthly body, I assign it to the earth, for from it it emerged and of it it was made.

And I say that my cofradía Sangre de Cristo of Quauhtitlan will provide what is to be my shroud, and from it will come [payment for] my burial and a mass for me. My grandchild named Anastasia Leonor is to help with what is spent on account of the mass for me.

Notary: Bernardo de Santiago
