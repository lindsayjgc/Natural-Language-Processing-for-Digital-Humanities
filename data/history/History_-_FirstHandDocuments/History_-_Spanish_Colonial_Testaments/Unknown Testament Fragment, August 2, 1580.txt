And Martin Macuil knows about the two

chickens I paid him for; he is to give me my money so

that it will be spent for me. And there are 13 grown

turkey hens (European chickens?). They will belong to

my father. They will be divided; the part to belong to

him will be five (turkey hens), and three will belong to

my aunt; and three will belong to my elder brother, and

also three will belong to me (sic, making 14).

And three metates that belong to Juan Chocani and a

metate of mine are to be sold toward a mass.
