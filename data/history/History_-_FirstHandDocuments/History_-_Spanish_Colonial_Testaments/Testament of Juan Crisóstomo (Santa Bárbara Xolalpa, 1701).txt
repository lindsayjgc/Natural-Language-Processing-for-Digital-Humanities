May the precious revered name of God the father, God his precious son, and God the Holy Spirit be entirely praised. May it be done, amen. Jesus.

Today, Saturday the 14th of May 1701, I begin my testament, I named Juan Cris칩stomo in my tlaxilacalli of Santa B치rbara Xolalpa. I say that if I die in the future, I place my spirit and soul very entirely in the hands of my precious father God.

And I say that my earthly body is to be buried in the great church chapel of Rosario, where my revered father God and my revered mother will designate.

And I say that offerings are to be given to Jerusalem and to the hospital. And I say that my properties include maguey fields in Cacalotepetl, San Antonio, San Buenaventura, and Santa B치rbara.

And I say that my wife may suffer difficulty in burial expenses because of my long illness, but I leave enough land for my children to inherit.
