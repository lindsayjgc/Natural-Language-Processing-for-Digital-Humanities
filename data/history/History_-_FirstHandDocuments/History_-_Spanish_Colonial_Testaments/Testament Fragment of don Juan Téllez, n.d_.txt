- In the name of our lord Jesus Christ and of

his precious mother, the heavenly lady Holy Mary,

eternally true virgin, know all who see and read this

document that I, don Juan Téllez, whose home is here in

San Juan Evangelista Culhuacan, in the ward of Santa

María Asunción Amantlan Tianquiztenco, even though I

am sick, nonetheless my spirit and soul...and I truly

believe in the Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and God

the Holy Spirit, of just one essence and I believe all that

the Holy Church of Rome believes. Therefore now with

invocation and supplication of God our lord, I make and

ordain my testament.

- First I declare that I place my spirit entirely in the

hands of our lord God, since he made it and redeemed it

with his precious blood, and my body I give to the earth,

since from the earth it came.
