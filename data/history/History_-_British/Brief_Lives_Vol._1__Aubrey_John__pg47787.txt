PREFACE


The rules laid down for this edition have been fully stated in
the Introduction. It need only be said here that these have been
scrupulously followed.

I may take this opportunity of saying that the text gives Aubrey's
quotations, English and Latin alike, in the form in which they are
found in his MSS. They are plainly cited from memory, not from book:
they frequently do not scan, and at times do not even construe. A few
are incorrect cementings of odd half lines.

The necessary excisions have not been numerous. They suggest two
reflections. The turbulence attributed to Sir Walter Raleigh seems to
have made his name in the next age the centre of aggregation of quite
a number of coarse stories. In the same way, Aubrey is generally nasty
when he mentions the noble house of Herbert, earl of Pembroke, and
the allied family of Sydney. There may be personal pique in this, for
Aubrey thinks he had a narrow escape from assassination by a Herbert
(i. 48); perhaps also there may be the after-glow of a Wiltshire 'feud'
(i. 316).

The Index gives all references to persons mentioned in the text, except
to a few found only in pedigrees, or otherwise quite insignificant;
also to all places of which anything distinctive is said.

SYNOPSIS OF THE 'LIVES'


In the text the Lives have been given in alphabetical order of the
names. This was necessary, not only on account of their number--more
than 400--but because Aubrey, in compiling them, followed more than one
principle of selection, writing, first, lives of authors, then, lives
of mathematicians, but bringing in also lives of statesmen, soldiers,
people of fashion, and personal friends.

The following synopsis of the lives may serve to show (i) the heads
under which they naturally fall, (ii) their chronological sequence.

The mark † indicates the year or approximate year of death; ‡ denotes a
life which Aubrey said he would write, but which has not been found; §
is attached to the few names of foreigners.

AUBREY'S 'BRIEF LIVES'




INTRODUCTION


I. ORIGIN OF THE 'LIVES.'

Aubrey sought and obtained an introduction to Anthony Wood in August
1667. He was keenly interested in antiquarian studies, and had the
warmest love for Oxford; he had been a contemporary in Trinity College
with Wood's brother, Edward; and so was drawn to Wood on hearing that
he was busy with researches into the History of the University of
Oxford.

Aubrey was one of those eminently good-natured men, who are very
slothful in their own affairs, but spare no pains to work for a friend.
He offered his help to Wood; and, when it was decided to include in
Wood's book short notices of writers connected with Oxford, that help
proved most valuable. Aubrey, through his family and family-connexions,
and by reason of his restless goings-to-and-fro, had a wide circle of
acquaintance among squires and parsons, lawyers and doctors, merchants
and politicians, men of letters and persons of quality, both in town
and country. He had been, until his estate was squandered, an extensive
and curious buyer of books and MSS. And above all, being a good gossip,
he had used to the utmost those opportunities of inquiry about men and
things which had been afforded him by societies grave, like the Royal
Society, and frivolous, as coffee-house gatherings and tavern clubs.
The scanty excerpts, given in these volumes, from letters written by
him between 1668 and 1673, supply a hint of how deeply Wood's _Historia
et Antiquitates Universitatis Oxoniensis_, published in 1674, was
indebted to the multifarious memory and unwearying inquiries of the
enthusiastic Aubrey.

Dean Fell's request that Wood should notice Oxford writers and bishops
in his _Historia_ had suggested to Wood the plan of, and set him to
work upon, the larger and happier scheme of the _Athenae Oxonienses_,
an 'exact history of all the writers and bishops that have had their
education in ... Oxford' since 1500. He engaged his friend Aubrey
to help him in his undertaking, by committing to writing in a more
systematic way, for Wood's benefit, his multitudinous recollections of
men and books. He was dexterous enough to supply the additional motive,
that, after serving his friend's turn, Aubrey's collections might be
gathered together, preserved for a while in some safe and secret place,
and, when personal feelings were saved by lapse of time, be published
and secure their writer a niche in the Temple of Fame.

It was now by no means easy for Aubrey to undertake any extensive,
and especially any connected work. Being by this time bankrupt, and a
hanger-on at the tables of kindred and acquaintances, he had to fall in
with his patrons' habits, at the houses where he visited; to sit with
them till they wearied of their carousings in the small hours of the
morning; and to do his writing next forenoon, before they had slept off
their wine.

Still, his interest in the subject, and his desire to help his friend
prevailed; and we soon find him thanking Wood for setting him to work.
March 27, 1680[1]:--''Twill be a pretty thing, and I am glad you putt
me on it. I doe it playingly. This morning being up by 10, I writt two
<lives>: one was Sir John Suckling[2], of whom I wrote a leafe and
1/2 in folio.' May 22, 1680[3]:--'My memoires of lives' <is now> 'a
booke of 2 quires, close written: and after I had began it, I had such
an impulse on my spirit that I could not be at quiet till I had donne
it.' Sept. 8, 1680[4]:--'My booke of lives ... they will be in all
about six-score, and I beleeve never any in England were delivered so
faithfully and with so good authority.'

Aubrey, therefore, began these lives[5] on the suggestion of, and with
a desire to help Anthony Wood.

Among the lives so written were several of mathematicians and men
of science. And another friend of Aubrey's, Dr. Richard Blackburne,
advised him to collect these by themselves, and add others to them,
with a view to a biographical history of mathematical studies in
England. To this suggestion Aubrey was predisposed through his pride
at being 'Fellow of the Royal Society,' and for some time he busied
himself in that direction[6].

In the same way, although the bulky life of Thomas Hobbes[7] was
partly undertaken in fulfilment of a promise to Hobbes himself, an old
personal friend, the motive which induced Aubrey to go on with it was
a desire to supply Dr. Blackburne with material for a Latin biography,
_Vitae Hobbianae Auctarium_, published in 1681.

These matters will be found more fully explained in the notices
which Aubrey has prefixed to the several MSS. of his biographical
collections, as described below.


II. CONDITION OF THE TEXT OF THE 'LIVES.'

Few of the 'Lives' are found in a fair copy[8]. Again and again, in his
letters to Anthony Wood, Aubrey makes confession of the deficiencies of
his copy, but puts off the heavy task of reducing it to shape.

His method of composition was as follows. He had a folio MS. book,
and wrote at the top of a page here and there the name of a poet, or
statesman, or the like, whose life he thought of committing to paper.
Then, selecting a page and a name, he wrote down hastily, without notes
or books, his recollections of the man, his personal appearance, his
friendships, his actions or his books. If a date, a name, a title of a
book, did not occur to him on the spur of the moment, he just left a
blank, or put a mark of omission (generally, ... or----), and went on.
If the matter which came to him was too much for the page, he made an
effort to get it in somehow, in the margins (top, bottom, or sides),
between the paragraphs, or on the opposite page.

When he read over what he had written in the first glow of composition,
he erased, wrote alternatives to words and phrases, marked words,
sentences, and paragraphs for transposition, inserted queries:
unsettled everything.

If later on, from books or persons, he got further information, he
was reckless as to how he put in the new matter: sometimes he put it
in the margin, sometimes at a wrong place in the text, or on a wrong
leaf, or in the middle even of another life, and often, of course, in a
different volume.

And there, as has been said, the copy was left. Very seldom was a
revised copy made.

To the confusions unavoidable in composing after this fashion, must be
added the unsteadiness consequent on writing in the midst of morning
sickness after a night's debauch. One passage, in which he describes
his difficulties in composing, explains, in a way nothing else
could, the frequent erasures, repetitions, half-made or inconsistent
corrections, and dropping of letters, syllables, and words, which
abound in his MSS. March 19, 1680/1[9]; 'if I had but either one
to come to me in a morning with a good scourge, or did not sitt-up
till one or two with Mr. <Edmund> Wyld, I could doe a great deal of
businesse.'


III. AIM OF THIS EDITION.

In presenting a text of Aubrey's 'Lives,' an editor, on more than one
important point, has to decide between alternatives.

    1. Shall all, or some only, of the lives be given?

    It is plain, from a glance over the MSS., that many of the
    lives are of little interest; in some cases, because they
    contain more marks of omission than statements of fact; in
    other cases, because they give mainly excerpts from prefaces of
    books; and so on. A much more interesting, as well as handier,
    book would be produced, if the editor were to reject all lives
    in which Aubrey has nothing of intrinsic value to show.

    2. In the lives selected, shall the whole, or parts only, of
    what Aubrey has written be given?

    Many sentences occur, which declare only Aubrey's ignorance of
    a date, or a place, or the title of a book. In other cases,
    dull and imperfect catalogues of writings are given. The
    omission of these would be a service to the whole, like the
    cutting of dead branches out of a shrub.

    3. In constituting the text, how much, or how little, notice is
    to be taken of the imperfections of Aubrey's copy?

    The simplest, and, from some points of view, the most
    effective, course would be to treat Aubrey's rough draft as if
    it were one's own, rejecting (without comment) one or other
    of two alternatives, supplying (without mark) a missing word
    or date, omitting a second version (though having some minor
    peculiarities) of a statement, and so on. In this way, with
    a minimum of trouble to the editor, a smooth text would be
    produced, which would spare the reader much irritation.

    4. How far is the text to be annotated, the editor supplying
    Aubrey's abundant omissions, and correcting his many mistakes?

In respect of all these questions, the aim of the present edition, and
the reasons for the decision taken in each case, can be stated very
briefly and decidedly.

    1, and 2. This edition seeks to give in full all that Aubrey
    has written in his four chief MSS. of biographies, MSS. Aubrey
    6, 7, 8, and 9.

    The entire contents of these MSS. will thus be placed beyond
    that risk of perishing, to which they must have remained liable
    so long as they were found only in MS., and they will, for what
    they are worth, henceforth be accessible to all.

    Some things in Aubrey's writing offend not merely against our
    present canons of good taste, but against good morals. The
    conversation of the people among whom Aubrey moved, although
    they were gentry both in position and in education, was often
    vulgar, and occasionally foul, as judged by us. I have dealt
    with these lives as historical documents, leaving them, with a
    very few excisions, to bear, unchecked, their testimony as to
    the manners and morals of Restoration England.

    3. This edition seeks to present faithfully Aubrey's text as he
    wrote it, neglecting only absolute minutiae.

    (_a_) A plain text is given of what Aubrey wrote, taking,
    as seemed most convenient, sometimes his first version of
    a sentence or a word, sometimes his alternative version.
    The rejected alternatives are given in the textual notes,
    as 'duplicate with'; and occasionally the erasures, as
    'substituted for.' Many of these notes are very trivial; but
    their presence, which after all gives little trouble, provides
    a complete view of the MS. text. I believe also that in this
    way I have preserved for the collector of words some quaint
    forms and expressions for which he will thank me, and provided
    the student of English style with some apt instances of the way
    in which terse native words have been replaced in our written
    language by feebler Latinisms.

    (_b_) I have been careful to give, in every case, Aubrey's own
    spelling, with or without final or medial 'e,' with single or
    double letters, 'ie' or other diphthong where we write 'ei,'
    and the like. The English of Aubrey's age is so like our own
    that it is not unimportant to mark even its minor differences.

    All merely artificial tricks of writing (wᶜʰ for which, and the
    like) have been neglected.

    (_c_) Where a date, a word, or a name has been inserted, the
    insertion is enclosed in angular brackets < >. Where it seemed
    requisite to mark that a word or phrase was added at a later
    date, or by another hand, square brackets have been used [].
    The use of these symbols, borrowed from Vahlen's edition of
    Aristotle's _Poetics_, has been censured as pedantic, but I
    know of no clearer or shorter way of making plain in a printed
    text just what is, and what is not, in the MS. text.

    (_d_) Punctuation is generally absent in Aubrey's text,
    as might be expected, and where it is found, it is often
    misleading. The points and marks in this edition are therefore
    such as seemed to make the meaning clear to myself, and
    therefore, I hope, to others.

    (_e_) As regards the order of the paragraphs, Aubrey's text
    has been given, where convenient, sentence by sentence, and
    page by page. But I have taken full liberty to bring into their
    proper place _marginalia_, interlinear notes, _addenda_ on
    opposite pages, &c. In some cases, indeed, to give in print the
    MS. text sentence by sentence is to do it injustice. In the
    MS., the difference of inks between earlier and later notes,
    the difference of pen-strokes (on one day with a firm pen, on
    another with a scratchy quill), and similar nuances, impress
    the eye with a sequence of paragraphs which in print can be
    shown only by redistribution. For example, I claim that the
    life of Milton, in this edition, is, from its bolder treatment,
    truer to the MS., than the servile version in the old edition.

    4. As regards notes and explanations. Aubrey's lives supply
    an inviting field for comment, correction, and addition. But,
    even so treated, they will never be a biographical dictionary.
    Their value lies not in statement of bibliographical or other
    facts, but in their remarkably vivid personal touches, in what
    Aubrey had seen himself and what his friends had told him. The
    notes therefore seek to supply no more than indications of
    outstanding features of the text, identifications of Aubrey's
    informants, or necessary parallels from his letters.


IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE MSS.

=MS. Aubr. 6=: a volume chiefly of folio leaves; written mostly in
February 1679/80; now marked as containing 122 leaves (some pages
blank), but having also a few unfoliated slips. Aubrey's own short
title to it was:--

                  'Σχεδιάσματα. Brief Lives, part i.,'

and, in his pagination, it contained eighty-six leaves. A rough index
of its contents, by him, is found as foll. 8-10: and there he gives
the names of several persons whose lives he intended to write, but
has not included in this volume. Some of these are found elsewhere,
especially in MS. Aubrey 8; but a few[10] are not discoverable in any
MS. of his biographical collections--e.g., Richard Alcorne; <Samuel>
Collins, D.D.; Richard Blackbourne, M.D.; <John> Flamsted[11]; Sir John
Hoskins; James Rex; James, duke of Monmouth[12]; Peter Ramus; Benjamin
Ruddier; captain <Edward> Sherburne; captaine Thomas Stump[13]; Richard
White. Possibly Aubrey never wrote the missing lives; but it must be
remembered (1) that he cut some leaves out of his MS. himself (see in a
note to the life of Richard Boyle, earl of Cork); (2) that Anthony Wood
cut out of MS. Aubr. 7 forty pages at least, containing matters 'to
cut Aubrey's throat,' i.e. reflections on politics, where the lives of
James R. and Monmouth may well have been.

One point about this MS. which deserves mention is that, in these
lives, Aubrey, in his hope to supply data for crucial instances in
astrology, is careful to give the exact nativity wherever he can. His
rule is thus laid down by himself in MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 12ᵛ, in a note
attached to the nativity of his friend Sir William Petty:--

                          'Italian proverb--

                  "E astrologia, ma non é Astrologo,"

i.e. we have not that science yet perfect; 'tis one of the
_desiderata_. The way to make it perfect is to gett a supellex of
true genitures; in order wherunto I have with much care collected
these ensuing[14], which the astrologers may rely on, for I have sett
doune none on randome, or doubtfull, information, but _from their owne
mouthes_: quod N. B.'

Another point is, that Aubrey very frequently gives the coat of arms,
in trick or colour. In some cases, no doubt, he did this from having
seen the arms actually borne in some way by the person he is writing
about; but in other cases he merely looked up the name in a 'Dictionary
of Arms,' and took the coat from thence, thus nullifying his testimony
as to the actual pretensions to arms of those he writes about. All
coats he mentions have, however, been given in the text or notes.

Prefixed to the volume[15] are two notes in which Aubrey explains its
origin and destination.


(A)--MS. Aubr. 6, fol.[16] 2:--

                    '_Tanquam tabulata naufragii_,
                      Sum Johannis Aubrii, R.S.S.
                         Febr. 24, 1679/80.

My will and humble desire is that these minutes, which I have hastily
and scriblingly here sett downe, be delivered carefully to my deare and
honoured friend Mr. Anthony à Wood, antiquary, of Oxford.--

          Ita obnixe obtestor,

                                    JO. AUBREY.

  Ascenscione Domini,

       correptus lipothymiâ, circiter 3 P.M.

                        1680.'


(B)--MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 12:--

                 'To my worthy friend Mr. ANTHONIE à WOOD,

                           Antiquarie of Oxford.

  SIR!

I have, according to your desire, putt in writing these minutes of
lives tumultuarily, as they occurr'd to my thoughts or as occasionally
I had information of them. They may easily be reduced into order at
your leisure by numbring them with red figures, according to time and
place, &c. 'Tis a taske that I never thought to have undertaken till
you imposed it upon me, sayeing that I was fitt for it by reason of my
generall acquaintance, having now not only lived above halfe a centurie
of yeares in the world, but have also been much tumbled up and downe in
it which hath made me much[17] knowne; besides the moderne advantage of
coffee-howses in this great citie, before which men knew not how to be
acquainted, but with their owne relations, or societies. I might add
that I come of a longaevous race, by which meanes I have imped some
feathers of the wings of time, for severall generations; which does
reach high. When I first began, I did not thinke I could have drawne it
out to so long a thread.

I here lay-downe to you (out of the conjunct friendship[18] between
us) the trueth, and, as neer as I can and that religiously as a
poenitent to his confessor, nothing but the trueth: the naked and
plaine trueth, which is here exposed so bare that the very _pudenda_
are not covered[19], and affords many passages that would raise a blush
in a young virgin's[20] cheeke. So that after your perusall, I must
desire you to make a castration (as Raderus[21] to Martial) and to
sowe-on some figge-leaves--i.e., to be my _Index expurgatorius_.

What uncertainty doe we find in printed histories? they either
treading too neer on the heeles of trueth that they dare not speake
plaine, or els for want of intelligence (things being antiquated)
become too obscure and darke! I doe not here repeat any thing already
published (to the best of my remembrance) and I fancy my selfe all
along discourseing with you; alledgeing those of my relations and
acquaintance (as either you knew or have heerd of) _ad faciendam
fidem_: so that you make me to renew my acquaintance with my old and
deceased friends, and to _rejuvenescere_ (as it were) which is the
pleasure of old men. 'Tis pitty that such minutes had not been taken
100 yeares since or more: for want wherof many worthy men's names and
notions[22] are swallowd-up in oblivion; as much of these also would
[have[23] been], had it not been through your instigation: and perhaps
this is one of the usefullest pieces[24] that I have scribbeld.

I remember one sayeing of generall Lambert's, that "the best of men
are but men at the best": of this, you will meet with divers examples
in this rude and hastie collection. Now these _arcana_ are not fitt to
lett flie abroad, till about 30 yeares hence; for the author and the
persons (like medlars) ought to be first rotten. But in whose hands
must they be deposited in the mean time? advise me, who am,

                                   Sir,
                       Your very affectionate friend
                               to serve you,

                                                    JOHN AUBREY.

  London,
  June 15,
    1680.'


=MS. Aubr. 7=: a folio volume of twenty-one leaves (several pages
blank), of which two[25] only belong to the original MS.

The original title may be conjectured to have been:

                 'Σχεδιάσματα. Brief Lives, part ii.,'

and it possibly contained some letters, like those in the preceding
volume, which made Wood think it was given to him.

On fol. 1, is a note describing the make-up of the volume:--

'Aubrey's Lives: fragments of part ii.--These scattered fragments
collected and arranged by E. M. Sep. 1792.' A note (in Dr. Philip
Bliss's hand?) says that E. M. is Edmund Malone.

In this, as in the other Aubrey MSS., Dr. Bliss has made several slight
notes, both in pencil and ink, with a view to his edition.

The mutilation of the MS. was the crime of Anthony Wood, to whom it had
been sent. Two conjectures may be hazarded--either that Wood did this
in order to paste the cuttings into his rough copy of his projected
_Athenae_, and so save transcription; or, more probably, that he was
so thoroughly alarmed by the threat of Lord Clarendon's prosecution of
himself (Clark's Wood's _Life and Times_, iv. 1-46), that he destroyed
the papers containing Aubrey's sharp reflections on various prominent
personages[26]. But whatever the pretext, Aubrey was, naturally, very
grieved at his unjustifiable conduct. In a letter to Wood, dated Sept.
2, 1694 (MS. Ballard 14, fol. 155), he writes:--

'You have cutt out a matter of 40 pages out of one of my volumnes,
as also the index. Was ever any body so unkind?--And I remember you
told me comeing from Hedington that there were some things in it that
"would cutt my throat." I thought you so deare a friend that I might
have entrusted my life in your hands and now your unkindnes doth almost
break my heart.'

When Aubrey had the volume back in his own hands, he wrote in it[27]
the following censure:--

'Ingratitude! This _part the second_ Mr. Wood haz gelded from
page 1 to page 44 and other pages[28] too are wanting wherein are
contained trueths, but such as I entrusted nobody with the sight of
but himselfe (whom I thought I might have entrusted with my life).
There are severall papers that may cutt my throate. I find too late
_Memento diffidere_ was a saying worthy one of the sages. He hath also
embezill'd the index of it--quod N. B. It was stitch't up when I sent
it to him.

                           Novemb. 29, 1692.'


=MS. Aubr. 8=: a folio volume, containing 105 leaves: it contains two
distinct MSS., bound together.

The first part of the MS. (foll. 1-68 in the present marking) might
have been entitled:--

            'Σχεδιασματα. Brief Lives, part iii.'

On fol. 1 and fol. 3, the short title actually written by Aubrey is:--

                                  ʻ♄
                              Pars iiiᵗⁱᵃ

                                 1681

                                  ᴊᴬʼ

i.e. the symbol for Saturn, the patron of antiquarian studies, and
Aubrey's monogram. On fol. 4 Aubrey has a very elaborate title, showing
the destination of the MS.:--

'Auctarium vitarum a ᴊᴬ collectarum, anno Domini 1681.

                     _Tanquam tabulata naufragii._

                          John Aubrey, R.S.S.

    Le mal est que la vive voix meurt en naissant et ne laisse rien
    qui reste apres elle, ni formant point de corps qui subsiste en
    l'air. Les paroles ont des aisles; vous scavez l'epithete[29]
    qu'Homère leur donne, et un poëte Syrien en a fait un espece
    parmy les oiseaux; de sorte que, si on n'arreste pas ces
    fugitives par l'ecriture, elles eschappent fort vistement à la
    memoire.

             Ornari res ipsa nolit contenta doceri.--HORAT

For Mr. Anthony Wood
at
                                Oxford.'

A slip by Anthony Wood, pasted here, shows that Aubrey recalled the
MS., probably to make additions to it:--

  'Mr. AUBREY,

I beseech you as you have been civill in giving this book to me at Oxon
in Sept. 1681, so I hope when you have done with it you'l returne every
part of it againe to your servant,

                                                    ANT. WOOD.'

As originally made up, this 'Auctarium' contained four leaves at the
beginning (for an index[30]), and leaves foliated 1-38 (of which 12 and
13 are now[31] missing).

The second part[32] of the MS. extends over foll. 69-103 in the present
marking.

Aubrey, on fol. 69, writes the title:--

                      'An Apparatus for the lives
                  of our English mathematical writers
                                  by
                        Mr. John Aubrey, R.S.S.
                           March 25, 1690.'

As originally made up, this treatise consisted of one leaf (for an
index[33]) and pages marked 1-46 (of which pp. 31-38 are now missing).

The history of this treatise is fully set out by Aubrey in some notes
in it and in the other MSS.:--

1. It was suggested by Richard Blackburne.

MS. Aubr. 7, fol. 8ᵛ:--'Dr. <Richard> Blackbourn would have me putt out
in print the lives of our English mathematicians together.'

2. It had been partly anticipated by Selden and Sherburne.

MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 70:--'My purpose is, if God give me life, to make an
_apparatus_, for[34] the lives of our English Mathematicians; which
when I have ended, I would then desire Mr. Anthony Wood to find out one
that is master of a good Latin stile, and to adde what is[35] already
in his printed booke[36] to these following[37] minutes.

'I will not meddle with our own writers[38] in the mathematicks before
the reigne of king Henry VIII, but prefix those excellent verses of
Mr. John Selden (with a learned commentary to them) which are printed
before a booke intituled <Arthur> Hopton's _Concordance of yeares_[39]
scilicet:--

       *       *       *       *       *'

MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 69:--'Sir Edward Shirbourn, somewhere in his
translation and notes upon Manilius, has enumerated our English
mathematicians, and hath given short touches of their lives--which see.'

3. The first step towards it would be to pick out the mathematicians
from the lives already written by Aubrey.

MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 51ᵛ:--'I would have the lives of John Dee, Sir Henry
Billingsley, the two Digges (father and sonne), Mr. Thomas Hariot, Mr.
<Walter> Warner, Mr. <Henry> Brigges, and Dr. <John> Pell's, to be
putt together.--As to the account of Mr. Hariot, Mr. Warner, and Mr.
Brigges, I recieved it from Dr. Pell.'


=MS. Aubr. 9=: a folio, containing fifty-five leaves, and in addition
several printed papers.

The title is found on fol. 28 (as now marked) of the MS.:--

                  'Supplementum vitae Thomae Hobbes,
                           Malmesburiensis,
                              1679/80

       *       *       *       *       *

                                 I. A.'

I. A. = Aubrey's initials.

The reason for this title was that Aubrey intended his Collections to
be a sort of commentary on Hobbes' short Latin autobiography, which was
in the press in Febr. 1679/80, and was published in Nov. 1680 (Clark's
Wood's _Life and Times_, ii. 480, 500).

But Anthony Wood (MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 28) objected:--'What need you say
Supplimentum?' _sic_ 'pray say the life of Thomas Hobbs.' And Aubrey,
in obedience to this, changed the short title on fol. 30 (see the
beginning of the life); and on the parchment cover of the MS. (now fol.
1) wrote:--

                             'The life of
                          Mr. Thomas Hobbes,
                             of Malmsbury,
                                  by
                           Mr. John Aubrey,
                    Fellow of the Royall Societie,
                             1679/80.'

Aubrey set about this Life of Hobbes immediately after Hobbes' death,
partly as a tribute of respect to his friend's memory, but apparently
also in fulfilment of a promise to the deceased. The preface[41] is as
follows:--

                               'LECTORI.

'Tis religion to performe the will of the dead; which I here[42]
dischardge, with my promise (1667) to my old friend Mr. T<homas>
H<obbes>, in publishing[43] his life and performing the last office to
my old[44] friend Mr. Thomas Hobbes, whom I have had the honour to know
<from> my child-hood[45], being his countreyman and borne in Malmesbury
hundred and taught my grammar by his schoolmaster[46].

Since nobody knew so many particulars of his life as myselfe, he was
willing[47] that if I survived him, it should be handed to posterity by
my hands, which I declare and avow to do ingenuously and impartially,
to prevent misreports and undecieve those who are scandalized by....

One sayes[48] that when a learned man dyes, a great deal of
learning dyes with him. _He_ was 'flumen ingenii,' never dry. The
_recrementa_[49] of so learned a person are[50] valueable[I.]. Amongst
innumerable observables of him which had deserved to be sett downe,
these few (that have not scap't[51] my memory) I humbly offer[52]
to the present age and posterity, _tanquam tabulam naufragii_[II.],
and as plankes and lighter things swimme, and are preserved, where
the more weighty sinke and are lost. And[53] as with the light
after sun-sett--at which time, clear[54]; by and by[55], comes the
_crepusculum_; then, totall darkenes--in like manner is it with matters
of antiquitie. Men thinke, because every body remembers a memorable
accident shortly after 'tis donne, 'twill never be forgotten, which
for want of registring[56], at last is drowned in oblivion. Which[57]
reflection haz been a hint, that by my meanes many antiquities have
been reskued[58], and preserved (I myselfe now inclining[59] to be
ancient[60])--or els utterly lost and forgotten.

[I.] We read that an earthen lamp of a philosopher (quaere nomen) hath
been sold for....

[II.] Vide Erasmi _Adagia_ and quaere Dr. <Richard> Bl<ackburne>.

For that I am so minute, I declare I never intended it, but setting
downe in my first[61] draught every particular[62], (with purpose, upon
review, to retrench[63] what was superfluous and triviall), I shewed
it to some friends of mine (who also were of Mr. Hobbes's acquaintance)
whose judgments I much value, who gave their opinion: and 'twas clearly
their judgement[64], to let _all_ stand; for though to soome at present
it might appeare too triviall; yet hereafter 'twould not be scorned[65]
but passe[66] for antiquity.

And besides I have precedents of reverend writers to plead, who have in
some lives[III.] recited things as triviall[67], nay, the sayings and
actions of good woemen.

[III.] Dean Fell hath recorded his mother's jejune sayings and actions
and triviall remarques of Dr. Hammond in his life, written by him.

I am also to beg pardon of the reader for two long digressions, viz.
Malmesbury and Gorambery; but this also was advised, as the only way
to preserve them, and which I have donne for the sake of the lovers of
antiquity. I hope its novelty and pleasantness will make compensation
for its length.

  Yours[68],

                                    I. A.'

In MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 28ᵛ are two letters by Aubrey, asking advice in
connexion with this life.


i. _Aubrey to Anthony Wood._

'To his honoured friend Mr. Anthony à Wood, Master of Arts, at Merton
College in Oxon.

  Deare friend!

I have hastily writt this third draught, which I hope is legible: I
have not time to read it over. Pray peruse it as soon as you can, for
time drawes on. Dr. Blackburne and I will be diligent in it and will
doe _you_ all the right[69] your heart can wish. I thought together
with this to have sent you the transcript of Mr. Hobbes' life revised
by himselfe but am prevented by hast, and 'tis the last day of the
terme. I will send it suddenly.

My service to Mr. Pigot. I am, Sir, your affectionate friend and
servant,

                                                     JO. AUBREY.

  London Feb. 12,
    1679/80.

Why might not his two sheetes _Of heresie_ be bound up with this to
preserve it and propagate trueth?

I know here be severall tautologies; but I putt them downe thus here,
that upon reviewe I should judge where such or such a thing would most
aptly stand.

Why should not Dr. Blackbourne in the life of Mr. H. written by him
selfe quote that of A. Wood in the margent for a blindation, because
there are in great part the very same words?'


ii. _Aubrey to Richard Blackburne._

  'Dr. Blackbourne!

Pray advise me whether 'twould not shew handsomest to begin with a
description of Malmesbury, and then to place Mr. H. pedigre?

But, with all, should not

"Thomas Hobbes was borne at Malmesbury, Apr. ... 1588[70]"

be the initiall and, as it were, textuall, line?

Shall I in the first place putt Mr. H. life donne by himselfe? (If so,
whether in Latin, or English, or both?) Or else, shall I intersperse it
with these animadversions?

I could begin with a pleasant description of Malmesbury, etc., (all new
and untoucht) 14 leaves in 8vo, which his verses will lead me to, and
which Ant. Wood seemes to desire.

Pray be my Aristarchus, and correct and marke what you thinke fitt.
First draughts[71] ought to be rude as those of paynters, for he that
in his first essay will be curious in refining will certainly be
unhappy in inventing.

Doctor, I am your affectionate and humble servant.

                                                                   J. A.

I will speake to Fleetwood Shepherd to engage the earl of Dorset to
write in the old gentleman's praise.

Should mine be in Latin or English or both? (And by whome the Latin, if
so?) Is my English style well enough[72]?'


=Other MSS.= A few additional lives, and portions of lives, of persons
mentioned in these four biographical volumes, have been brought in from
letters by Aubrey in MS. Ballard 14 and in MS. Wood F 39 and F 49.

Three lives, in fair copy, by Aubrey, are found in MS. Rawlinson D.
727, foll. 93-96, and have been given here. They were formerly in
Anthony Wood's hands: see Clark's Wood's _Life and Times_, iv. 192,
note.

MS. Aubr. 21, a volume made up in the Ashmolean library from
siftings out of Aubrey MSS. and papers; MS. Aubr. 22, a collection
of grammatical tracts, brought together by Aubrey with a view to a
treatise on education; MS. Aubr. 23, a volume of 125 leaves, dated on
fol. 8 as 'Collectio geniturarum, made London May 29, 1674,' but on
the title as '1677: for the <Ashmolean> Musaeum'; MS. Aubr. 26,'Faber
fortunae,' i.e. projects for retrieving Aubrey's fortunes----have
yielded additional matter.


V. THE OLD EDITION.

The pith of these lives was extracted by Anthony Wood, and incorporated
in his _Athenae_, vol. i. in 1691, vol. ii. in 1692, and the 'appendix'
left in MS. at his death (published in the second edition of the
_Athenae_ in 1721).

The MSS. of Aubrey's 'Lives' were placed in the library of the
Ashmolean Museum, in the personal custody of the Keeper, Edward Lhwyd,
in 1693. Aubrey, writing[73] to Thomas Tanner, intimates that his MSS.
will show how greatly Wood's _Athenae_ was indebted to his help, and
makes a special request that Wood shall not know that they have been
placed in the Museum.

Beginning[74] on Sept. 16, 1792, Edmund Malone made a transcript of
174 lives from the three MSS. (MS. Aubr. 6, 7, 8), with notes, with a
view to publication. The first volume of this contained folios 1-152,
forty-four lives of poets and sixty-eight of prose writers. It is now
in the Bodleian, by the gift of C. E. Doble, Esq.; but mutilated,
folios 126-152 having been torn off from the end of the volume. The
second volume, containing folios 153-385, sixty-two lives, was MS. 9405
in Sir Thomas Phillipps' library, was mentioned in _Notes and Queries_
(8 S. vii. 375), and has recently been bought by the Bodleian.

Some years later, James Caulfield, of London, publisher, arranged
for the issue of a select number of biographies from Aubrey's MSS.,
illustrated by engravings from originals in the Ashmolean and
elsewhere. They were to appear under the title of 'The Oxford Cabinet';
and one part, 32 pp., a very pretty book, was published at London in
1797. This part contains the lives of William Aubrey, Francis Bacon,
John Barclay, and Francis Beaumont, with engravings (inter alia) of
Aubrey's drawings of Verulam House, and Bacon's fishponds. At this
point the Keeper of the Ashmolean, at Malone's instance, withdrew
the permission which had been granted to Curtis to transcribe for
Caulfield. The reason given was that Curtis had taken away papers and
title-pages from Oxford libraries, and was not to be trusted in the
Ashmolean--see Macray's _Annals of the Bodleian_, p. 273.

The dates, however, suggest that Malone's action may have been in part
inspired by a wish to keep the course clear for his own project. The
transcription made for Caulfield, although not always accurate in point
of spelling, is by no means badly done: certainly it is much better
than that which was made for the later issue.

In 1813 appeared '_Letters written by Eminent Persons ... and Lives
of Eminent Men by John Aubrey, Esq. ..._ from the originals in the
Bodleian Library and Ashmolean Museum: in two volumes.' The editors are
said to have been Dr. Philip Bliss and the Rev. John Walker, Fellow of
New College.

The _Lives_ by Aubrey occupy pp. 197-637 of Volume II.

Dr. Bliss's interests were bibliographical, and he was not careful[75]
to collate with original MSS. either the printed text of earlier
editions or transcripts made for himself. As a result, that issue of
Aubrey's Lives, although making accessible the greater portion of what
is interesting in the originals, is marred by many grave blunders and
arbitrary omissions.

A comparison of a few pages of Dr. Bliss's edition with Aubrey's MS.
copy suggests a troublesome question in English textual criticism. If
two eminent Oxford scholars in the beginning of the nineteenth century
could thus pervert their author's meaning, can we have trust in the
earlier redaction of greater texts, such as Shakespeare?




THE 'LIVES'




=George Abbot= (1562-1633).


[76]Archbishop Abbot was borne in the howse of old Flemish building,
timber and brick, now an alehouse, the signe 'Three Mariners,' by
the river's side by the bridge on the north side of the street in
St. Nicholas parish on the right hand as you goe out of the towne
northwards.

[77]Old Nightingale was his servant, and weepes when he talkes of him.
Every one that knew, loved him. He was sometimes cholerique.

He was borne the first howse over the bridge on the right hand in St.
Nicholas parish <Guildford>. He was the sonne of a sherman[78]. His
mother, with child of him, longed for a jack, and dream't that if shee
could eate a jack, her son should be a great man. The next morning,
goeing to the river, which runs by the howse (which is by the bridge),
with her payle, to take up some water, a good jack came into her payle.
Which shee eat up, all, her selfe. This is generally recieved for a
trueth.

His godfather and godmothers sent him to the University, his father not
being able.




=Sir Robert Aiton= (1570-1638).

[A] Sir Robert Aiton[79], knight;--he lies buried in the south aisle of
the choire of Westminster abbey, where there is erected to his memory
an elegant marble and copper monument and inscription--viz.

_This long inscription is in copper:--_

                                 M. S.

    Clarissimi, omnigenaque virtute et eruditione (presertim
    poesi) ornatissimi equitis, Domini Roberti Aitoni, ex antiqua
    et illustri gente Aitona ad Castrum Kinnadinum apud Scotos
    oriundi: qui a serenissimo rege Jacobo in cubicula interiora
    admissus; in Germaniam ad imperatorem imperiique principes,
    cum libello regio regiae authoritatis vindice, legatus; ac
    primum Annae, demum Mariae, serenissimis Britanniarum reginis,
    ab epistolis, consiliis, et libellis supplicibus; necnon
    Xenodochio S'ᵃᵉ Catharinae praefectus; anima Creatori reddita,
    hic, depositis mortalibus exuviis, secundum redemptoris
    adventum expectat.

    _Carolum_ linquens, repetit _Parentem_;
    Et valedicens _Mariae_, revisit
    _Annam_; et _Aulaei_ decus alto _Olympi_
                                         Mutat honore.

    Obiit coelebs in Regiâ Albaulâ, non sine maximo bonorum omnium
    luctu et moerore:

             Aetat. suae LXVIII, Salut. humanae MDCXXXVIII.

    Hoc devoti gratique animi testimonium optimo patruo, Jo.
    Aitonus, M.L.P.

_In white marble at the bottome of the monument:--_

    Musarum decus hîc, patriaeque, aulaeque, domique
    Et foris exemplar, sed non imitabile, honesti.

His bust is of copper, curiously cast, with a laurell held over it by
two figures of white marble.

That Sir Robert was one of the best poets of his time--Mr. John Dreyden
sayes he has seen verses of his, some of the best of that age, printed
with some other verses--quaere.

He was acquainted with all the witts of his time in England. He was a
great acquaintance of Mr. Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury, whom Mr. Hobbes
told me he made use of (together with Ben Johnson) for an Aristarchus,
when he made his Epistle Dedicatory to his translation of Thucydides. I
have been told (I think by Sir John himself) that he was eldest brother
to Sir John Ayton, Master of the Black Rod, who was also an excellent
scholar.


_Note._

[A] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'..., on a cross engrailed between
4 crescents a rose,' with the motto

                      'Et decerpta dabunt odorem.'

He encircles the coat of arms with a laurel wreath, as is his custom
when it is a poet whose life he is writing.




=Aldsworth.=


[80]... Aldsworth, mathematical boyes.

[81]Memorandum:--the patent for the mathematicall blew-coate boyes at
Christ Church in London was dated '19th August in the 25th yeare of the
reigne of king Charles the second' <1673>.




=Thomas Allen= (1542-1632).


[82]Thomas Allen, Trin. Coll. Oxon.--Elias Ashmole, esqr., <has> the
MSS. of Thomas Allen's commentary on the second and third bookes of
Ptolomey's Quadripartite[83].

[84]Thomas Allen--vide Anthony Wood's _<Hist. et> Antiq. <Univ.> Oxon._

Mr. Thomas Allen[B] was borne in Staffordshire.

Mr. Theodore Haak, a German, Regiae Societatis Socius, was of Glocester
Hall, 1626, and knew this learned worthy old gentleman, whom he takes
to have been about ninety-six yeares old when he dyed, which was about
1630 (vide).

The learned <Edmund> Reynolds, who was turned Catholique[IV.] by his
brother the learned Dr. <John> Reynolds, President of Corpus Xti
Colledge, was of Glocester Hall then too. They were both neer of an
age, and they dyed both within 12 monethes one of th'other[C]. He was
at both their funeralls. Mr. Allen came into the hall to commons, but
Mr. Reynolds had his brought to his chamber.

[IV.] Memorandum the Latin verses made on their mutual
conversions--which insert.

Bella inter ... plusquam civilia fratres.

He sayes that Mr. Allen was a very cheerfull, facetious man, and that
every body loved his company, and every howse on their _Gaudie-dayes_
were wont to invite him.

His picture was drawne at the request of Dr. Ralph Kettle, and hangs in
the dining roome of the President of Trin. Coll. Oxon. (of which house
he first was, and had his education there) by which it appeares that he
was a handsome sanguine man, and of an excellent habit of bodie.

There is mention of him in _Leicester's Commonwealth_[85] that
the great Dudley, earle of Leicester, made use of him for casting
nativities, for he was the best astrologer of his time. He hath written
a large and learned commentary, in folio, on the Quadripartite of
Ptolemie, which Elias Ashmole hath in MS. fairly written, and I hope
will one day be printed.

In those darke times astrologer, mathematician, and conjurer, were
accounted the same things; and the vulgar did verily beleeve him to be
a conjurer. He had a great many mathematicall instruments and glasses
in his chamber, which did also confirme the ignorant in their opinion,
and his servitor (to impose on freshmen and simple people) would tell
them that sometimes he should meet the spirits comeing up his staires
like bees. One[V.] of our parish[VI.] was of Glocester Hall about
70 yeares and more since, and told me this from his servitor. Now
there is to some men a great lechery in lying, and imposing on the
understandings of beleeving people, and he thought it for his credit to
serve such a master.

[V.] J. Power[D].

[VI.] Kington <S. Michael, Wilts>.

He was generally acquainted, and every long vacation, he rode into
the countrey to visitt his old acquaintance and patrones, to whom
his great learning, mixt with much sweetnes of humour, rendred him
very welcome. One time being at Hom Lacy[86] in Herefordshire, at Mr.
John Scudamore's (grandfather to the lord Scudamor), he happened
to leave[87] his watch in the chamber windowe--(watches were then
rarities)--The maydes came in to make the bed, and hearing a thing in
a case cry _Tick, Tick, Tick_, presently concluded that that was his
Devill, and tooke it by the string with the tongues[88], and threw it
out of the windowe into the mote (to[89] drowne the Devill.) It so
happened that the string hung on a sprig of an elder that grew out of
the mote, and this confirmed them that 'twas the Devill. So the good
old gentleman gott his watch again.

Sir Kenelm Digby loved him much (vide Sir K. Digby's Life <p.>
69[90]), and bought his excellent library of him, which he gave to the
University. I have a Stifelius' Arithmetique that was his, which I find
he had much perused, and no doubt mastered. He was interred in Trinity
College Chapell, (quaere where: as I take it, the outer Chapell.)
George Bathurst[E] B.D. made his funerall oration in Latin, which was
printed. 'Tis pitty there had not been his name on a[91] stone over him.

[92]Thomas Allen ... left the house[93] because he would not take
orders.

Queen Elizabeth sent for him to have his advice about the new star that
appeared in the Swan or Cassiopeia (but I think the Swan), to which he
gave his judgment very learnedly.

He was great-uncle to Mr. <Henry> Dudley, the minister of Broadhinton
in Wilts <1665>.


_Notes._

[B] Thomas Allen, of Staffordshire, aged 17, was elected Scholar of
Trinity, June 4, 1561, and Fellow, June 19, 1564. His retirement to
Gloucester Hall was no doubt to avoid the Oath of Supremacy imposed
by Elizabeth on members on the foundation of the Colleges. Edmund
Reynolds, in the same way, retired to Gloucester Hall, vacating his
fellowship in Corpus Christi College.

[C] Edmund Reynolds died Nov. 21, 1630; Thomas Allen died Sept. 30,
1632.

[D] This will serve to show how imperfectly the names in the
Matriculation-register represent those who actually studied in Oxford.
The Matric. register gives '_Zachary Power_, e com. Wilts.,' as
matriculating at Gloucester Hall, Nov. 3, 1609: but omits his elder
brother John Power (mentioned in MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 48, as being 40 in
1624, when Zachary was 32).

[E] George Bathurst, of Ga<r>sington, Oxon, aged 16, was elected
Scholar of Trinity June 6, 1626, and Fellow June 8, 1631; B. D. 1640.
His _Oratio funebris_ on Allen was publ. London 1632.




=Charles Alleyn= (obiit 1640?).


[94]Charles Alleyn, who wrote the Battailes of Agencourt, Poitiers, and
Crescy, was usher to Mr. Thomas Farnaby.




=Lancelot Andrewes= (1555-1626).


[95]Lancelot Andrewes[F], lord bishop of Winton, was borne in London;
went to schoole at Merchant Taylors schoole. Mr. Mulcaster[G] was his
schoolemaster, whose picture he hung in his studie (as Mr. Thomas
Fuller, _Holy State_).

Old Mr. Sutton, a very learned man of those dayes, of Blandford St.
Maries, Dorset, was his school fellowe, and sayd that Lancelot Andrewes
was a great long boy of 18 yeares old at least before he went to the
university.

He was a fellowe[96] of Pembroke-hall, in Cambridge (called _Collegium
Episcoporum_, for that, at one time, in those dayes, there were of that
house ... bishops).

The Puritan faction did begin to increase in those dayes, and
especially at Emanuel College. That party had a great mind to drawe in
this learned young man, whom if they could make theirs, they knew would
be a great honour to them. They carried themselves outwardly with great
sanctity and strictnesse, so that 'twas very hard matter to----as to
their lives. They preached up very strict keeping and observing the
Lord's day; made, upon the matter, damnation to breake it, and that
'twas lesse sin to kill a man then.... Yet these hypocrites did bowle
in a private green at their colledge every Sunday after sermon; and
one of the colledge (a loving friend to Mr. L. Andrewes) to satisfie
him one time lent him the key of a private back dore to the bowling
green, on a Sunday evening, which he opening, discovered these zealous
preachers, with their gownes off, earnest at play. But they were
strangely surprized to see the entrey of one that was not of _the
brotherhood_.

There was then at Cambridge a good fatt alderman that was wont to sleep
at church, which the alderman endeavoured to prevent but could not.
Well! this was preached against as a signe of _reprobation_. The good
man was exceedingly troubled at it, and went to Andrewes his chamber
to be satisfied in point of conscience. Mr. Andrewes told him that
<it> was an ill habit of body not of mind, and that it was against his
will; advised him on Sundays to make a more sparing meale and to mend
it at supper. The alderman did so, but sleepe comes upon <him> again
for all that, and was preached at. <He> comes againe to be resolved,
with tears in his eies; Andrewes then told him he would have him make
a good heartie meale as he was wont to doe, and presently take out
his full sleep. He did so[97]; came to St. Marie's[98], where the
preacher was prepared with a sermon to damne all who slept at sermon,
a certaine signe of _reprobation_. The good alderman having taken his
full nap before, lookes on the preacher all sermon time, and spoyled
the designe.--But I should have sayd that Andrewes was most extremely
spoken against and preached against for offering to assoile or excuse
a sleeper in sermon time. But he had learning and witt enough to[99]
defend himselfe.

His great learning quickly made him known in the university, and also
to King James, who much valued him for it, and advanced him, and at
last[100] made him bishop of Winchester, which bishoprick he ordered
with great prudence as to government of the parsons, preferring
of ingeniose persons that were staked to poore livings and did
_delitescere_. He made it his enquiry to find out such men. Amongst
severall others (whose names have escaped my memorie) Nicholas Fuller
(he wrote _Critica Sacra_), minister of Allington neer Amesbury in
Wilts, was one. The bishop sent for him, and the poor man was afrayd
and knew not what hurt he had donne. <He> makes him sitt downe to
dinner; and, after the desert, was brought in in a dish his institution
and induction, or the donation, of a prebend: which was his way. He
chose out alwayes able men to his chaplaines, whom he advanced. Among
others, <Christopher> Wren, of St. John's in Oxon, was his chaplaine,
a good generall scholar and good orator, afterwards deane of Winsore,
from whom (by his son in lawe, Dr. William Holder) I have taken this
exact account of that excellent prelate.

His Life is before his Sermons, and also his epitaph, which see. He
dyed at Winchester house, in Southwark, and lies buried in a chapell
at St. Mary Overies, where his executors ... Salmon M. D. and Mr. John
Saintlowe, merchant of London, have erected (but I beleeve according to
his lordship's will, els they would not have layed out 1000 _li._) a
sumptuose monument for him.

He had not that smooth way of oratory as now. It was a shrewd and
severe animadversion of a Scotish lord, who, when king James asked him
how he liked bp. A.'s sermon, sayd that he was learned, but he did play
with his text, as a Jack-an-apes does, who takes up a thing and tosses
and playes with it, and then he takes up another, and playes a little
with it. Here's a pretty thing, and there's a pretty thing!

[101]Bishop Andrews: vide the inscription before his _Sermons_.

[F] Aubrey gives the coat:--'See of Winchester; impaling ..., 3 mullets
on a bend engrailed and cottised ...,' ensigned with a mitre or, and
encircled by the Garter motto.

1561-1586.




=Francis Anthony= (1550-1623).


[102]Dr. [Francis[103]] Anthony, the chymist, Londinensis, natus 16
Aprilis, 1550, 1ʰ. P.M., Virgo 0° 3´ ascend.

Quaere A<nthony> W<ood> if of Oxon or Cambridge[104].

Scripsit 2 libros, viz.:--_Aurum potabile_, and his _Defense_ against
Dr. <Matthew> Gwyn (who wrote a booke called _Aurum non Aurum_). This
is all that Mr. Littlebury, bookeseller, remembers.

He lived in St. Bartholomew's close, London, where he dyed, and is, I
suppose, buried there, about 30 yeares since[H], scil. 1652.

Vide his nativity in Catalogue[I].

He had a sonne who wrote something, I thinke (quaere Mr. Littlebury);
and a daughter maried to ... Montague, a bookeseller in Duck-lane, who
in Oliver's time was a soldier in Scotland.


_Notes._

[H] Wood notes here 'so that by this reckoning,' i.e. if born in 1550
_ut supra_, 'he was 102.'

[I] i.e., I suppose, in MS. Aubrey 23 (Aubrey's _Collectio
Geniturarum_), where at fol. 121, among nativities from Dr. Richard
Napier's papers, is:--'Dr. Anthony, Londinensis, who made _aurum
potabile_ at London, natus 16 April, 1550, 1ʰ P.M.'




=Thomas Archer= (1554-1630?).


[105]Mr. Archer, rector of Houghton Conquest, was a good scholar in
King James's (the 1st) dayes, and one <of> his majestie's chaplains.

He had two thick 4to MSS. of his own collection; one, _joci_ and tales
etc., and discourses at dinners; the other, of the weather. I have
desired parson Poynter[106], his successor, to enquire after them, but
I find him slow in it. No doubt there are delicate things to be found
there.




=John Ashindon= (obiit 13--?).


[107]Johannes Escuidus[108], Merton College:--Elias Ashmole, esq., hath
the corrected booke by the originall MSS. of Merton College library,
now lost, which is mentioned in Mr. William Lilly's almanack 1674, a
folio.

Amongst many other rarities he haz a thin folio MS. of Alkindus in
Latin.

[109]Johannes Escuidus:--Summa astrologiae judicialis, in folio,
Venetiis, 1489.--It is miserably printed, he sayes there; and that he
was a student of Merton College Oxford.--Mr. Elias Ashmole has the
booke.




=Elias Ashmole= (1617-1692).


[110]Memorandum--the lives of John Dee, Dr. <Richard> Nepier, Sir
William Dugdale, William Lilly, Elias Ashmole[111], esq.,--Mr. Ashmole
haz and will doe those himselfe: as[112] he told me formerly but nowe
he seemes to faile.




=Deborah Aubrey= (1609/10-1685/6).


[113]Mris. Deborah Aubrey, my honoured mother, was borne at
Yatton-Kaynes, _vulgo_ West-Yatton, in the parish of Yatton-Keynel in
com. Wilts., January 29ᵗʰ 1609[114], mane.

In a letter from my mother, dated Febru. 3ᵈ, 1679/80, she tells me she
was seaventie yeares old the last Thursday [29 Januarii]--quod N. B.


_Her accidents._

My mother was maried at 15 yeares old.

She fell sick of a burning feaver at Langford, Somerset.

She was taken on the 6ᵗʰ June 1675; feaver there againe in July 1675.

She was borne Jan. 29ᵗʰ, morning, scil. the day before the
anniversary-day of the king's decollation. She was 15 yeares old and as
much as from January to June when she was maried.

She fell from her horse and brake her ... arme the last day of Aprill
(1649 or 50) when I was a suitor to Mris Jane Codrington.

Lettre, Aug. 8, 1681:--she was lately ill three weekes and now her eies
are a little sore.

Memorandum: 6 Januarie 1682/3, my mother writes to me that she is 73
yeares of age.


_Note._

She died at Chalk in Jan. 1685/6, and was buried at Kingston S.
Michael; so in a letter by Aubrey to Anthony Wood, May 11, 1686, in MS.
Ballard 14, fol. 139.




=John Aubrey= (1626-1697).

    <These autobiographical jottings are found in MS. Aubr. 7,
    fol. 3-5. They have been printed, with a few slips and slight
    omissions, in John Britton's _Memoir of J. Aubrey_, London,
    1845, pp. 12-17. Aubrey (fol. 3) directs that the paper is 'to
    be interposed as a sheet of wast paper only in the binding of a
    booke'; and appends to this direction the motto:--

      'I presse not to the choire[115] ...
    Thus devout penitents of old were wont,
    Some without dore, and some beneath the font.

                                                      Mr. Thomas Carew.'

    Aubrey gives (fol. 3) an (incomplete) drawing of his own
    horoscope, on the scheme:--

    'ᴊᴬ natus 1625/6, March 11th, 17ʰ 14´ 44˝ P.M. ...[116] (tempus
    verum), sub latitudine 51° 30´.'

    In MS. Aubr. 21, fol. 110, is Charles Snell's calculation of
    Aubrey's nativity, on the scheme

    'Sunday, 12 Martii 1626, 5ʰ 13´ 40˝ A.M., natus Johannes
    Aubreius, armiger, sub polo 51° 06´. The astrologers of the
    time used sometimes the English, and sometimes the Italian,
    enumeration of the hours.>


[117]I. A[118].

His life[119] is more remarqueable in an astrologicall respect[J] then
for any advancement of learning[K], having[120] from his birth (till
of late yeares) been labouring under a crowd of ill directions: for
his escapes of many dangers[L], in journeys both by land and water, 40
yeares.

He was borne (longaevous, healthy kindred[M]) at Easton Pierse[N],
a hamlet in the parish of Kington Saint Michael in the hundred of
Malmesbury in the countie of Wilts, his mother's[O] (daughter and heir
of Mr. Isaac Lyte) inheritance, March the 12 (St. Gregorie's day[P]),
A.D. 1625[121], about sun-riseing, being very weake and like to dye
that he was christned before morning prayer.

I gott not strength till I was 11 or 12 yeares old; but had
sicknesse[122] of vomiting[Q], for 12 houres every fortnight for ...
yeares, then about monethly, then quarterly, and at last once in halfe
a yeare. About 12 it ceased.

When a boy, bred at Eston, an[123] eremiticall solitude. Was[124] very
curious; his greatest delight to be continually with the artificers
that came there (e.g. joyners, carpenters, coupers, masons), and
understood their trades.

1634[125], was entred in his Latin grammar by Mr. R<obert> Latimer[R],
rector of Leigh de-la-mere, a mile's fine walke, who had an easie
way of teaching: and every time we askt leave to _goe forth_, we had
a Latin word from him which at our returne we were[126] to tell him
again--which in a little while amounted to a good number of words.
'Twas my unhappinesse in half a yeare to loose this good enformer
by his death, and afterwards was under severall dull ignorant
rest[127]-in[127]-house teachers[S] till 1638 (12[128]), at which
time I was sent to Blandford schole in Dorset (William Sutton[129],
B.D., who was ill-natured).

Here I recovered my health, and gott my Latin and Greeke, best of any
of my contemporaries. The[130] usher[131] had (by chance) a Cowper's
Dictionary, which I had never seen before. I was then in Terence.
Percieving his method, I read all in the booke where Terence was, and
then Cicero--which was the way[132] by which I gott my Latin. 'Twas a
wonderfull helpe to my phansie, my reading of Ovid's _Metamorphy_ in
English by Sandys, which made me understand the Latin the better. Also,
I mett accidentally a booke of my mother's, Lord Bacon's _Essaies_,
which first opened my understanding as to moralls (for Tullie's
_Offices_ was too crabbed for my young yeares) and the excellence[133]
of the style, or hints and transitions.

I[134] was alwayes enquiring[T] of my grandfather[135] of the old time,
the rood-loft, etc., ceremonies, of the priory, etc. At 8, I was a kind
of engineer; and I fell then to drawing, beginning first with plaine
outlines, e.g. in draughts of curtaines. Then at 9 (crossed herein
by father and schoolmaster), to colours, having no body to instruct
me[136]; copied pictures in the parlour in a table booke----like[U].

Blandfordiae, horis vacuis, I drew and painted Bates's ... (quaere
nomen libri[V]).

I was wont (I remember) much to lament with my selfe that I lived not
in a city, e.g. Bristoll, where I might have accesse to watchmakers,
locksmiths, etc. <I did> not very much care for grammar. <I had>
apprehension enough, but my memorie not tenacious. So that then[137]
was a promising morne enough of an inventive and philosophicall
head. <I had a> musicall head, inventive, <wrote> blanke verse,
<had> a strong and early impulse to antiquitie (strong impulse to
♄[138]). <My> witt was alwaies working, but not adroict for verse.
<I was> ex<ceeding[139]> mild of spirit; migh<tily> susceptible of
fascination.[140] My idea very cleer[141]; phansie like[142] a mirrour,
pure chrystal water which the least wind does disorder and unsmooth--so
noise or etc. would[143].

[144]My uncle Anthony Browne's bay nag threw me dangerously the Monday
after Easter[145], 1639. Just before it I had an impulse of the briar
under which I rode, which tickled him, at the gap at the upper end of
Berylane. Deo gratias!

[146]1642, May 2ᵈ, I went[W] to Oxford.

Peace[147].

Lookt through Logique and some Ethiques.

1642, _Religio Medici_ printed, which first opened my understanding,
which I carryed to Eston, with Sir K. D.[148]

But now[149] Bellona thundered, and as a cleare skie is sometimes
suddenly overstretch<ed> with a dismall[150] cloud and thunder, so was
this serene peace[151] by the civill warres through the factions of
those times; vide Homer's Odyssey.

In August[152] following my father sent for me home, for feare.

In February ... following, with much adoe[153] I gott my father to lett
me to beloved Oxon againe, then a garrison pro rege.

I gott Mr. Hesketh, Mr. Dobson's man, a priest, to drawe the ruines of
Osney 2 or 3 wayes before 'twas pulld downe[X]. Now the very foundation
is digged-up.

In Aprill I fell sick of the small pox at Trinity College; and when
I recovered, after Trinity weeke[154], my father sent for me into
the country again: where I conversed[155] with none but servants and
rustiques and soldiers quartred, to my great griefe (_Odi prophanum
vulgus et arceo_), for in those dayes fathers were not acquainted with
their children. It was a most sad life to me, then in the prime of
my youth, not to have the benefitt of an ingeniose conversation and
scarce any good bookes--almost a consumption. This sad life I did lead
in the country till 1646, at which time I gott (with much adoe) leave
of my father to lett me goe to the Middle Temple, April the 6ᵗʰ 1646;
admitted....

24 June following, Oxon was surrendred, and then came to London many of
the king's party, with whom I[156] grew acquainted (many of them I knew
before). I loved not debauches[157], but their martiall conversation
was not so fitt for the muses.

Novemb. 6, I returned to Trinity College in Oxon again to my great
joy; was much made of by the fellowes; had their learned conversation,
lookt on bookes, musique. Here and at Middle Temple (off and on) I
(for the most part) enjoyd the greatest felicity of my life (ingeniose
youths, as[158] rosebudds, imbibe the morning dew[159]) till Dec. 1648
(Christmas Eve's eve) I was sent for from Oxon home again to my sick
father, who never recovered. Where I was engaged to looke after his
country businesse and solicite a lawe-suite.

Anno 165-, Octob. ..., my father dyed, leaving me debts 1800 _li._ and
bro<thers'> portions 1000 _li._

Quid digni feci, hîc process. viam? Truly nothing; only umbrages, sc.
Osney abbey ruines, etc., antiquities. _Cos_, a wheatstone, _exors
ipse secandi_, e.g. <my> universall character[160] <: that> which was
neglected and quite forgott and had sunk had not I engaged[161] in the
worke, to carry on the worke--name them[162].

He began to enter into pocket memorandum bookes philosophicall and
antiquarian remarques, Anno Domini 1654, at Llantrithid.

Anno 16--I began my lawe-suite on the entaile in Brecon[Y], which
lasted till ..., and it cost me 1200 _li._

Anno ---- I was to have maried Mris K. Ryves, who died when to be
maried, 2000 _li._ +[163], besides counting care of her brother, 1000
_li._ per annum.

Anno ---- I made my will[Z] and settled my estate on trustees,
intending to have seen the antiquities of Rome and Italy for ...
<years>, and then to have returned and maried, but--

                     Diis aliter visum est superis,

my mother, to my inexpressible griefe and ruine, hindred this[164]
designe, which was[165] my ruine.

[166]My estate (was of) value 100 _li. fere_ + Brecon.

Then debts and lawe-suites, _opus et usus_, borrowing of money and
perpetuall riding. To my prayse, <I had> wonderfull credit in the
countrey for money. Anno ... sold manor of Bushelton in Herefordshire
to Dr. T<homas> Willis. Anno ... sold the manor of Stratford in the
same county to Herbert <Croft> lord bishop of Hereford.

Then anno 1664, June 11, went into France. Oct. ... returned. Then Joan
Sumner.

[167]Memorandum. J. Aubrey in the yeare 1666, wayting then upon Joane
Sumner to her brother at Seen in Wilts, there made a discovery of a
chalybiate waters and those more impregnated than any waters yet heard
of in England. I sent some bottles to the Royal Society in June 1667,
which were tryed with galles before a great assembly there. It turnes
so black that you may write legibly with it, and did there, after so
long a carriage, turne as deepe as a deepe claret. The physitians were
wonderfully surprized at it, and spake to me to recommend it to the
doctors of the Bath (from whence it is but about 10 miles) for that in
some cases 'tis best to begin with such waters and end with the Bath,
and in some _vice versâ_. I wrote severall times, but to no purpose,
for at last I found that, though they were satisfied of the excellency
of the waters and what the London doctors sayd was true, they did not
care to have company goe from the Bath. So I inserted it last yeare in
Mr. Lilly's almanac, and towards the later end of summer there came so
much company that the village could not containe them, and they are now
preparing for building of houses against the next summer. Jo<hn> Sumner
sayth (whose well is the best) that it will be worth to him 200 _li._
per annum. Dr. <Nehemiah> Grew in his History of the Repository of the
Royal Society mentions this discovery, as also of the iron oare there
not taken notice of before----'tis in part iii, cap. 2, pag. 331.

[168]Then lawe-suite with her[169]. Then sold Easton-Peirse[AA], and
the farme at Broad Chalke. Lost 500 _li._ (Fr. H.) + 200 _li._ + goods
+ timber. Absconded as a banishd man.

Then

                      In monte Dei videbitur[170].

I was in as much affliction as a mortall could bee, and never quiet
till all was gone, <and I> wholly[171] cast myselfe on God's providence.

Monastery[172].

I wished monastrys had not been putt downe, that the reformers would
have been more moderate as to that point. Nay, the Turkes have
monasteries. Why should our reformers be so severe? Convenience
of religious houses--Sir Christopher Wren--fitt there should be
receptacles and provision for contemplative men; if of 500, but one
or two[173]. 'Tis compensated[174]. What a pleasure 'twould have been
to have travelled from monastery to monastery. The reformers in the
Lutheran countrys were more prudent then to destroy them (e.g. in
Holsatia, etc.); <they> only altered the religion.

But notwithstanding all these embarasments I did _pian piano_ (as they
occur'd) take[175] notes of antiquity; and having a quick draught, have
drawne landskips on horseback symbolically, e.g. <on my> journey to
Ireland in July, Anno Domini 166-.

<The> earl of Thanet[176] <gave me> _otium_ at Hethefield.

<I[177] had> never quiett, nor anything of happinesse till[178]
divested of all, 1670, 1671[AB]: at what time providence raysed me
(unexpectedly) good friends--the right honourable Nicholas, earl of
Thanet, with whom I was delitescent at Hethfield in Kent[AC] neer a
yeare, and then was invited ...; anno ..., Sarney; Sir Christopher
Wren; Mr. Ogilby; then Edmund Wyld, esq., R<egiae> S<ocietatis>
S<ocius>, of Glasely-hall, Salop (sed in margine), tooke me into his
armes, with whom I most commonly take my diet and sweet _otium's_.

Anno 1671, having sold all and disappointed as aforesaid of moneys I
received, I had so strong[179] an impulse[180] to (in good part) finish
my[181] _Description of Wilts_, two volumes in folio, that I could not
be quiet till I had donne it, and that with danger enough, tanquam
canis e Nilo, for feare of the crocodiles, i.e. catchpolls.----And
indeed all that I have donne and that little that I have studied have
been just after that fashion, so that had I not lived long my want of
leisure would have afforded but a slender harvest of....

A man's spirit rises and falls with his[182] ⦻: makes me lethargique.

[183]<My> stomach <was> so tender that I could not drinke claret
without sugar, nor white wine, but would disgorge. <It was> not well
ordered till 1670.

☞ A strange fate that I have laboured under never[184] in my life to
enjoy one entire monethe[VII.] or 6 weekes _otium_ for contemplation.

[VII.] Once at Chalke in my absconding Oct. anno ...; at Weston[185]
anno....

My studies (geometry) were on horse back[VIII.], and <in> the house of
office: (my father discouraged me). My head was alwaies working; never
idle, and even travelling (which from 1649 till 1670 was never off my
horsback) did gleane som observations, of which I have a collection
in folio of 2 quiers of paper + a dust basket, some wherof are to be
valued.

[VIII.] So I got my Algebra, Oughtred in my pocket, with some[186]

gett subscribers to come in for a share of these 1000 acres, for 200

[214]_Accidents of John Aubrey[AI]._

Borne at Easton-Piers, March 12, 1625/6, about sun-rising: very weake
and like to dye, and therfore Christned that morning before Prayer. I
thinke I have heard my mother say I had an ague shortly after I was
borne.

1629: about 3 or 4 yeares old, I had a grievous ague.

I can remember it. I gott not health till 11, or 12: but had sicknesse
of vomiting for 12 howres every fortnight for ... yeares; then, it came
monethly for ...; then, quarterly; and then, halfe-yearly; the last was
in June 1642. This sicknesse nipt my strength in the bud.

1633: 8 yeares old, I had an issue (naturall) in the coronall suture of
my head, which continued running till 21.

1634: October[215]: I had a violent fever that was like to have carried
me off. 'Twas the most dangerous sicknesse that ever I had.

About 1639 (or 1640) I had the measills, but that was nothing: I was
hardly sick.

1639: Monday after Easter weeke my uncle's nag ranne away with me, and
gave a very dangerous fall.

1642: May 3, entred at Trinity College, Oxon.

1643: April and May, the small-pox at Oxon; and shortly after, left
that ingeniouse place; and for three yeares led a sad life in the
countrey.

1646: April ----, admitted of the Middle Temple. But my father's
sicknesse, and businesse, never permitted me to make any settlement to
my studie.

1651: about the 16 or 18 of April, I sawe that incomparable good
conditioned gentlewoman, Mris M. Wiseman, with whom at first sight I
was in love--haeret lateri[216].

1652: October 21: my father died.

1655: (I thinke) June 14, I had a fall at Epsam, and brake one of my
ribbes and was afrayd it might cause an apostumation.

1656: September 1655, or rather (I thinke) 1656, I began my chargeable
and taedious lawe-suite about the entaile in Brecknockshire and
Monmouthshire.

This yeare, and the last, was a strange year to me, and[217] of
contradictions;--scilicet love M. W.[218] and lawe-suites.

1656: December: Veneris morbus.

[219]1657: Novemb. 27, obiit domina Katherina Ryves, with whom I was to
marry; to my great losse.

1658: ...[220]

1659: March or Aprill, like to breake my neck in Ely minster, and the
next day, riding a gallop there, my horse tumbled over and over, and
yet (I thanke God) no hurt.

1660: July, August, I accompanied A. Ettrick into Ireland for a moneth;
and returning were like to be ship-wrackt at Holy-head, but no hurt
donne.

1661, 1662, 1663: about these yeares I sold my estate in Herefordshire.

...[221]: Janu., had the honour to be elected fellow of the Royal
Society.

1664: June 11, landed at Calais. In August following, had a terrible
fit of the spleen, and piles, at Orleans. I returned in October.

1664, or 1665: Munday after Christmas, was in danger to be spoiled by
my horse, and the same day received laesio in testiculo which was like
to have been fatall. Quaere R. Wiseman quando--I beleeve 1664.

1665: November 1; I made my first addresse (in an ill howre) to Joane
Sumner.

1666: this yeare all my businesses and affaires ran kim kam. Nothing
tooke effect, as if I had been under an ill tongue. Treacheries and
enmities in abundance against me.

1667: December --: arrested in Chancery lane, at Mrs. Sumner's suite.

<1667/8>: Febr. 24, A.M. about 8 or 9, triall with her at Sarum.
Victory and 600 _li._ dammage, though divelish opposition against me.

1668: July 6, was arrested by Peter Gale's malicious contrivance, the
day before I was to goe to Winton for my second triall, but it did not
retain me above two howres; but did not then goe to triall.

1669[222]: March 5, was my triall at Winton, from 8 to 9, the judge
being exceedingly made against me, by my lady Hungerford. But 4 of the
Venue (?) appearing, and with much adoe, gott the moëity of Sarum,
verdict viz. 300 _li._

1669 and 1670: I sold all my estate in Wilts.

From 1670, to this very day (I thanke God), I have enjoyed a happy
delitescency.

1671: danger of arrests.

1677: later end of June, an imposthume brake in my head.

Laus Deo.

[223]Memorandum:--St. John's night, 1673, in danger of being run

Quaere the yeare[225] that I lay at Mris Neve's; for that time I was
in great danger of being killed by a drunkard in the street opposite
Grayes-Inne gate--a gentleman whom I never sawe before, but (Deo
gratias) one of his companions hindred his thrust. (Memorandum:

_Notes._

[J] This beginning of Aubrey's autobiography is explained by Henry
Coley's judgment on his nativity, found in MS. Aubr. 23, fol. 104,
on the scheme 'J. A. natus 1625/6, March 11th, 17ʰ 14´ 44˝ P.M., sub
latitudine 51° 30´.'

'The nativity,' Coley says, 'is a most remarkable opposition, and 'tis
much pitty the starres were not more favourable to the native.' Coley
goes on to state that the stars 'threaten ruin to land and estate; give
superlative vexations in matters relating to marriag, and wondrous
contests in law-suits--of all which vexations I suppose the native hath
had a greater portion than ever was desired.' Aubrey must have been
only too glad to have authority for attributing his failure in life to
the stars, and not to his own ill-conduct.

[K] In MS. Aubr. 7, fol. 3, in jottings at the side of his horoscope,
Aubrey suggests that his failure in this respect was due to defects of
his upbringing, not of natural ability.

Ἐὰν ᾖς φιλομαθής, ἔσῃ πολυμαθής. By _pian piano_ I might have <attained
to learning>; though <my> memory <was> not tenacious, <yet I had> zeale
to learning, and ...[227] extraordinary, ... ...[228]; <but I was> bred
ignorant at Eston.'

[L] Henry Coley, in his 'Observations upon the geniture' of Aubrey,
MS. Aubr. 23, fol. 105ᵛ, finds that the stars show that he 'will be in
great danger between the years of 40 and 50.'--On this Aubrey remarks:--

'Much about that time the native was several times in danger of
expiration, as,

first, by the e<arl> of P<embroke>;

2, a bruise of the left side;

3, a narrow escape of falling downe stayres; and,

lastly, as dangerous a fall from a horse;

besides the accident of sowneing, cum multis aliis.

1668: the native was in no small trouble, at least received
disparagement, by an arrest, and other untoward transactions.'

[M] In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 62 sqq., is a notice of Aubrey's family and of
Kington St. Michael.

See in 'Wiltshire: the Topographical Collections of John Aubrey,
corrected and enlarged by John Edward Jackson,' Devizes, 1862.

In MS. Aubr. 23, on a slip at fol. 47, Aubrey notes his father's
christening:--'Richard Aubrey, July 26, St. Anne's day, christened A.D.
1603.'

MS. Aubr. 23, fol. 83, notices Aubrey's brother William:--'My brother
William Aubrey's scheme by Henry Coley.--Natus Mr. W. A. March 20,
1642/3, at 11ʰ 30´ P.M.'

MS. Aubr. 23, fol. 119ᵛ, is the back of an envelope (seal, a pelican
feeding her young) addressed to Aubrey's third brother:--'to his very
loving freind Mr. Thomas Awbrey at Broad Chalke give these.'

[N] In MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 8, Aubrey notes:--

'John Aubrey <was> borne in the chamber where are on the chimney
painted the armes of Isaac Lyte and Israel Browne.'

MS. Aubr. 17 contains several of Aubrey's drawings, in pencil and
water-colours, of the house and grounds at Easton-Piers.

In MS. Aubr. 3 (his 'Hypomnemata Antiquaria'), fol. 55 sqq., is
Aubrey's description of Easton-Piers. It is printed in J. E. Jackson's
Aubrey's _Wiltshire Collections_ (Devizes, 1862), pp. 235 sqq.

[O] In MS. Aubr. 23, fol. 8, Aubrey notes:--'_ex registro Kington
St. Michael in com. Wilts_: June 15, Richard Aubrey and Debora Lyght
maried, 1625.'

[P] Aubrey in a marginal note seeks to bring his birth-day into
connexion with the Roman Quinquatria (March 19). The note is:
'Quinquatria: feast dedicated to Minerva' <dupl. with 'Pallas'>.

[Q] In MS. Aubr. 23 (his 'Collectio geniturarum'), fol. 116, 117, are
letters from Charles Snell about Aubrey's nativity and accidents. Snell
there enumerates Aubrey's:--

'Sicknesse att birth; ague and vomittings aboute 5 or 6 yeares old;
issue in his head; small-pox; amours with madam Wiseman[229]; selling
away the mannor of Stratford, etc.; haesitating in his speech.'

Snell gives this advice:--

'If the haesitation in your speech doth hinder, gett a parsonage of
4 or 500 _li._ per annum, and give a curat 100 _li._ per annum to
officiate for you.'

The letter is dated from 'Fordingbridge; 12 August, 1676.'

Aubrey, in his letters to Anthony Wood, several times touches on the
idea of his taking Orders. MS. Ballard 14, fol. 98:--'I am like to
be spirited away to Jamaica by my lord <John> Vaughan, who is newly
made governor there, and mighty earnest to have me goe with him and
will looke out some employment worthy a gentleman for me. Fough! the
cassock stinkes: it would be ridiculous.'--April 9, 1674. MS. Ballard
14, fol. 119:--'I am stormed by my chiefest friends afresh, viz. Baron
Bertie[230], Sir William Petty, Sir John Hoskyns, bishop of Sarum[231],
etc., to turne ecclesiastique; "but the king of France growes stronger
and stronger, and what if the Roman religion should come-in againe?"
"Why then!" say they, "_cannot you turne too?_" You, I say, know well
that I am no puritan, nor an enimy to the old gentleman on the other
side of the Alpes. Truly, if I had a good parsonage of 2 or 300 _li._
per annum, (as you told me) it would be a shrewd temptation.'--Aug. 29,
1676.

[R] Aubrey notes in the margin, (1) 'T. H.' (in a monogram), i.e.
that this Latimer had been schoolmaster to Thomas Hobbes, and (2),
'delicate little horse,' to indicate that he did not walk the mile
to Leigh-de-la-mere like a poor boy, but rode his pony there like a
fine gentleman. John Britton has mis-read the note, and made it a
description of Mr. Latimer's appearance, 'delicate little _person_.'

In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 109, Aubrey gives this inscription as on a stone
'under the communion-table' in the church of Leigh-de-la-mere:--

    'Here lieth Mr. Robert Latymer, sometime rector and pastor of
    this church, who deceased this life the second day of November,
    anno domini 1634.'

And then Aubrey notes:--

'This Mr. Latimer was schoolmaster at Malmsbury[232] to Mr. Thomas
Hobbes. He afterwards taught children here[233]. He entred me into my
accedence. Before Mr. Latimer, one Mr. Taverner was rector here, who
was the parson that maried my grand-father and grandmother Lyte.'

[S] In a marginal note (MS. Aubr. 7, fol. 3), Aubrey excuses his
father's neglect of his education on the plea that he himself grew up
illiterate. The note is:--

'My grandfather A<ubrey> dyed, leaving my father, who was not educated
to learning, but to hawking.' See in the life of Alderman John Whitson.

[T] In the margin Aubrey notes:--

'♄: strong impulse to ♄.' This means I suppose that the position of
Saturn at his nativity gave him a bias to the study of antiquities.

[U] This means, I suppose, that the copies he made sufficiently
resembled the pictures on the parlour wall. A note in MS. Aubr. 8, fol.
6ᵛ, perhaps refers to his own skill in drawing, 'As Mr. Walter Waller's
picture drawne after his death; è contra, I have done severall by the
life.' Walter Waller was vicar of Chalk, where Aubrey lived: see in the
life of Edmund Waller.

[V] Possibly "The mysteries of nature and art, viz.... drawing,
colouring ...," by J[ohn] B[ate], Lond. 1634, 4to.

[W] Here (fol. 3ᵛ) in the margin is written:--'Vide Pond,' referring
perhaps to a pocket almanac, in which Aubrey had marked the date of his
going up to Oxford. See Clark's Wood's _Life and Times_, i. 11, 12. In
a letter from Aubrey to Anthony Wood, of date Feb. 21, 1679/80, in MS.
Ballard 14, fol. 127, is this interesting note:--'At Trinity College we
writt our names in the Buttery-booke, when we were entred.'

Aubrey cites in the margin (MS. Aubr. 7, fol. 3ᵛ):--'HORAT. _Epist._
2ᵈ.' <i.e. _Epist._ ii. 2. 45>:--

    'Atque inter sylvas Academi quaerere verum.
    Dura sed emovere loco me tempora grato.'



[X] In MS. Wood F. 39, fol. 183, Aubrey, writing on Oct. 19, 1672,
tells Anthony Wood, 'you must not forgett that I have 3 other faces or
prospects of Osney abbey, as good as that now in the Monasticon. They
are in my trunke yet at Easton Piers.' Ibid., fol. 190ᵛ, on Oct. 22,
1672, he says, 'I will bring you about March my two other draughts of
Osney ruines, one by Mr. Dobson himselfe, the other by his man, one Mr.
Hesketh, but was a priest.'

Note that in MS. Wood F. 39, fol. 200, is a drawing (from memory) by
Aubrey of the stone-work which crowned the great earth-mound of Oxford
Castle.

[Y] In a slip at the end of MS. Aubr. 26 (Aubrey's _Faber Fortunae_, in
which he entered schemes by which he hoped to 'make his fortune'), is
this note:--

'I have the deed of entaile of the lands in South Wales, Brecon, and
Monmouthshire, by my grandfather, William Aubrey LL.D., which lands now
of right belong to me. Memorandum:--Mr. David Powell, who liveth at ...
(neer Llanverarbrin neer Llandvery, as I remember), can helpe me to the
counterpart of this deed of entaile in Wales--quod N. B.'

[Z] In MS. Aubr. 21, at fol. 75 is part of a draft of a will by Aubrey,
probably the one mentioned here (Ralph Bathurst became 'Dr.' in 1654):--

'Item, my will is that my executors buy for Trinity Colledge in Oxon
a colledge pott of the value of ten pounds, with my armes theron
inscribed; and ten pounds which I shall desire my honoured friends Mr.
Ralph Bathurst of Trinity College and Mr. John Lydall to lay out upon
mathematicall and philosophicall books.

Item, I give to the library of Jesus Colledge in Oxon my Greeke
_Crysostomus_, Bede's 2 tomes, and all the rest of my bookes that are
fitt for a library, as Mr. Anthony Ettrick[234] or Mr. John Lydall
shall think fitt, excepting those bookes that were my father's which I
bequeath to my heire.

Item, I bequeath to John Davenant of the Middle Temple, esq., a ring of
the value of 50_s._, with a stone in it.

Item, to Mr. William Hawes[235] of Trinity College aforsaid a ring of
the like value.

Item, to Mr. John Lydall[236] of the Colledge aforesaid a ring of the
like value.

Item, to Mr. Ralf Bathurst[237] of Trinity College aforesaid a ring of
the like value.

Item, to Mris Mary Wiseman of Westminster, my best diamond ring.'

[AA] On a slip at fol. 101 of MS. Aubr. 23 is the
jotting:--'Eston-pierse: possession given, 25 March, 1671, P.M.'

[AB] In his retirement during this year at Chalk, Aubrey tried his hand
at play-making. Writing to Anthony Wood on Oct. 26, 1671, MS. Wood, F.
39, fol. 141ᵛ, he says:--

'I am writing a comedy for Thomas Shadwell, which I have now almost
finished since I came here, et quorum pars magna fui. And I shall fit
him with another, _The Countrey Revell_, both humours untoucht, but
of this, mum! for 'tis very satyricall against some of my mischievous
enemies which I in my tumbling up and downe have collected.'

Of the first of these comedies, the autobiographical one, I have found
no trace: of the second, satirizing the men and manners of Wiltshire, a
very rude draft is found in MS. Aubr. 21.

[AC] In MS. Aubr. 23, fol. 113 is a note (dated 1672/3) from Henry
Coley, addressed:--

'For his much honoured friend Mr. John Aubrey, at the right honourable
the earle of Thanet's house at Hethfield in Kent, these present.'

The letter states that the writer has forwarded letters to and from
Aubrey; and concludes: 'you are much wanted at London, and dayly
expected, and therefore I hope you will not be long absent. Interest
calls for your appearance.'

[AD] i.e. which followed after this bleeding. Bleeding at the nose was
thought ominous: see Clark's Wood's _Life and Times_, iii. 289, note 1.

[AE] In MS. Aubr. 26, p. 17 is this note:--'The earle of Abington
to buy of Captain Poyntz the propriety of the island of Tobago, now
regnante Gulielmo III.'

[AF] Aubrey before this time had planned to retrieve his ruined
fortunes by colonial schemes: e.g., MS. Aubr. 26, p. 46:--'1676: from
Sir William Petty--<in> Jamaica 500 _li._ gives 100 per annum: take a
chymist with me, for brandy, suger, etc., and goe halfe with him.'

[AG] In consequence of this grant, Aubrey seriously thought of
emigrating. MS. Aubr. 26, p. 14:--

'Mr. Robert Welsted, goldsmith and banquier, saies that Mr. John
Evelyn's bookes are the most proper for a plantation. Also Markham's
husbandry and huswifry, etc. This is in order for Mr. W. Penn and
myselfe.--Also let him carry with him Mr. Haines booke of Cydar
Royall, which method will likewise serve for other fruites--it is by
distillation. Quaere of Mr. Tyndale's at Bunhill, who makes severall
sorts of English wines and cydars. Memorandum the great knack and
criticism is to know when it comes to its sowrenesse; it must not be
vinegar for then nothing will come--quod N. B.'

[AH] This is noticed on a slip (fragment of a letter, '8 March, 1692/3'
from Edward Harley) at fol. 113 of MS. Aubr. 23:--'J. A. vulneratus die
20 Martii inter 10 et 11 horas Londini. Deo gratias.'

[AI] This paper was acquired by Rawlinson in July ... 1746 (ibid. fol.
31ᵛ). There is an inaccurate copy of it in MS. Ballard 14, foll. 158,
159, which has the note:--'1754, June 11, transcribed from a MS. in Mr.
Aubrey's own writing in the possession of Dr. Richard Rawlinson.'




=William Aubrey= (1529-1595).


[238]William Aubrey[AJ], Doctor of Lawes:--extracted from a MS.[AK] of
funeralls, and other good notes, in the hands of Sir Henry St. George,
...[239], marked thus ♡. I guesse it to be the hand-writing of Sir
Daniel Dun, knight, LL. Dr., who maried Joane, third daughter of Dr.
William Aubrey:--

William Aubrey (the second son of Thomas Aubrey, the 4th son of
Hopkin Aubrey, of Abercunvrig in the countie of Brecon, esqre) in
the 66th yeare of his age or thereabouts, and on the 25th of June,
in the yeare of our Lord 1595, departed this life, and was buried in
the Cathedrall-church of St. Paul in London, on the north side of
the chancell, over against the tombe of Sir John Mason, knight, at
the base or foot of a great pillar standing upon the highest step of
certain degrees or staires rising into the quire eastward from the
same pillar towards the tombe of the right honble the lord William,
earle of Pembroke, and his funeralls were performed the 23d of July,
1595. This gentleman in his tender yeares learned the first grounds of
grammar in the College of Brecon, in Brecknock towne, and from thence
about his age of fourteen yeares he was sent by his parents to the
University of Oxford, where, under the tuition and instruction of one
Mr. Morgan, a great learned man, in a few yeares he so much profited in
humanity and other recommendable knowledge, especially in Rhetorique
and Histories, as that he was found to be fitt for the studie of the
Civill Law, and thereupon was also elected into the fellowship[240] of
All-soules Colledge in Oxford (where the same Lawe[241] hath alwayes
much flourished). In which Colledge he ernestly studied and diligently
applied himselfe to the lectures and exercise of the house, as that he
there attained the degree of a Doctor of the Law Civill at his age of
25 yeares, and immediately after, he had bestowed on him the Queen's
Publique Lecture of Law in the university, the which he read with so
great a commendation as that his fame for learning and knowledge was
spred far abroad and he also esteemed worthy to be called to action in
the commonwealth. Wherefor, shortly after, he was made Judge Marshall
of the Queen's armies at St. Quintins in France. Which warrs finished,
he returned into England, and determining with himselfe, in more
peaceable manner and according to his former education, to passe on the
course of his life in the exercise of law, he became an advocate of the
Arches, and so rested many yeares, but with such fame and credit as
well for his rare skill and science in the[242] law, as also for his
sound judgment and good experience therein, as that, of men of best
judgment, he was generally accounted peerlesse in that facultie.

Wherupon, as occasion fell out for imployment of a civilian, his
service was often used as well within the realme as in forrein
countries. In which imployments, he alwaies used such care and
diligence and good circumspection, as that his valour and vertues dayly
more appearing ministred means to his further advancement. In soe
much that he was preferred to be one of the Councell of the Marches
of Wales, and shortly after placed Master of the Chancery, and the
appointed Judge of the Audience, and constituted Vicar Generall to the
Lord Archbishop of <Canterbury> through the whole province, and last,
by the especiall grace of the queene's most excellent majestie, queen
Elizabeth, he was taken to her highnesse nearer service and made one of
the Masters of Request in ordinarie. All which titles and offices (the
Mastership of Chancery, which seemed not competible with the office of
Master of Requestes, only excepted) he by her princely favour possessed
and enjoyed untill the time of his death. Besides the great learning
and wisdome that this gentleman was plentifully endowed withall, Nature
had also framed him so courteous of disposition and affable of speech,
so sweet of conversation and amiable behaviour, that there was never
any in his place better beloved all his life, nor he himselfe more
especially favoured of her majestie and the greatest personages in
the realme in any part of his life then he was when he drew nearest
his death. He was of stature not taull, nor yet over-low, not grosse
in bodie, and yet of good habit; somewhat inclining to fatnesse of
visage in his youth; round, well favoured, well coloured and lovely;
and albeit in his latter yeares sicknesse had much[243] impaired his
strength and the freshnesse of his hew, yet there remained there still
to the last in his countenance such comely and decent gravity, as that
the change rather added unto them then ought diminished his former
dignitie. He left behind him when he died, by a vertuouse gentlewoman
Wilgiford his wife (the first daughter of Mr. John Williams of Tainton
in the countie of Oxford, whom he maried very young a maiden, and
enjoyed to his death, that both having lived together in great love and
kindnesse by the space of 40 yeares) three sons and six daughters, all
of them maried, and having issue, as followeth[IX.].

[IX.] Vide pedegre.

His eldest son Edward, maried unto Joane, daughter and one of the
heires of William Havard, in the countie of Brecon, esqre.

His second son Thomas maried Mary the daughter and heire of Anthony
Maunsell of Llantrithed, in the com. of Glamorgan, esqre.

His 3d son John,[X.] being then of the age of 18 yeares (or much
thereabouts), was maried to Rachel, one of the daughters of Richard
Danvers of Tockenham, in com. Wilts, esqre.

[X.] John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury, was his guardian, and
the doctor's great friend. I have heard my grandmother say that her
husband told her that his grace kept a noble house, and that with
admirable order and oeconomie; and that there was not one woman in the
family.--Vide the archbishop of Canterbury's case in Sir Edward Cooke's
_Reportes_ where he is mentioned.

His eldest daughter Elizabeth, maried to Thomas Norton of Norwood in
the countie of Kent, esqre.

His 2d daughter Mary maried William Herbert of Krickhowell, in the
countie of Brecknock, esqre.

His 3d daughter Joane maried with Sir Daniel Dun, knight, and Doctor of
the Civill Lawe.

His 4th daughter Wilgiford maried to Rise Kemis of Llanvay, in the
county of Monmouth, esqre.

His 5th daughter Lucie maried to Hugh Powell, gent.

His 6th and youngest daughter Anne, maried to John Partridge, of
Wishanger, in the countie of Glocester, esqre.

Of every of the which since his death there hath proceeded a plentifull
issue.


_Additions by Aubrey._

Memorandum:--he was one of the delegates (together with Dr. Dale, &c.)
for the tryall of Mary, queen of Scots, and was a great stickler for
the saving of her life, which kindnesse was remembred by King James att
his comeing-in to England, who asked after[244] him, and probably[245]
would have made him Lord Keeper, but he dyed, as appeares, a
little[246] before that good opportunity happened. His majestie sent
for his sonnes[247], and knighted the two eldest, and invited them
to court, which they modestly and perhaps prudently, declined. They
preferred a country life.

You may find him mentioned in the History of Mary, queen of Scotts,
8vo, written, I thinke, by <John> Hayward; as also in Thuanus's
_Annales_, which be pleased to see[AL] and insert his words here in
honour to the Doctor's _Manes_. Dr. ... Zouch mentions him with respect
in his _De Jure Faeciali_, pag....; and as I remember, he is quoted
by Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, in his
Reports, about the legitimacy of the earle of Hertford.[XI.] Quaere if
it was Edward the father[AM], or els his son William, about the mariage
with the ladie Arbella Stuart?

[XI.] Memorandum: Mr. Shuter, the proctor, told me that the Doctor
appealed to Rome about the earle of Hartford's suite, tempore reginae
Elizabethae.

him in his Welsh grammar in folio, pag....; as also in his preface.]

[255]He was a good statesman; and queen Elizabeth loved him and was
wont to call him 'her little Doctor.' Sir Joseph Williamson, Principall
Secretary of Estate (first, under-Secretary), haz told me that in
the Letter-office are a great many letters of his to the queen and
councell[256].

He sate many times as Lord Keeper, durante bene placito, and made[257]
many decrees, which Mr. Shuter, etc., told me they had seen.

Vide Anthony Wood's _Hist. et Antiq._: he was principal of New Inne.

Memorandum:--the _Penkenol_, i.e. chiefe of the family, is my cosen
Aubrey of Llannelly in Brecknockshire, of about 60 or 80 _li._ per
annum inheritance; and the Doctor should have given a distinction; for
want of which in a badge on one of his servants' blew-coates, his cosen
William Aubrey[258], also LL. Dr., who was the chiefe, plucked it off.

The learned John Dee was his great friend and kinsman, as I find by
letters between them in the custody of Elias Ashmole, esqre, viz., John
Dee wrote a booke _The Soveraignty of the Sea_, dedicated to queen
Elizabeth, which was printed, in folio. Mr. Ashmole hath it, and also
the originall copie of John Dee's hand writing, and annexed to it is a
lettre of his cosen Dr. William Aubrey[259], whose advise he desired in
his writing on that subject.

He purchased Abercunvrig (the ancient seate of the family) of his cosen
Aubrey. He built the great house at Brecknock, his studie lookes on
the river Uske. He could ride nine miles together in his owne land in
Breconshire. In Wales and England he left 2500 _li._ per annum wherof
there is now none left in the family. He made one Hugh George (his
chiefe clark) his executor, who ran away into Ireland and cosened all
the legatees, and among others my grandfather (his youngest son) for
the addition of whose estate he had contracted with.... for Pembridge
castle in the com. of Hereford, which appeares by his will, and for
which his executor was to have payed. He made a deed of entaile (36
Eliz., 15<94>) which is also mentioned in his will, wherby he entailes
the Brecon estate on the issue male of his eldest son, and in defailer,
to skip the 2d son (for whom he had well provided, and had maried a
great fortune) and to come to the third. Edward the eldest had seaven
sonnes; and his eldest son, Sir William, had also seaven sonnes; and so
I am heire, being the 18th man in remainder, which putts me in mind of
Dr. Donne,

          For what doeth it availe
    To be the twentieth man in an entaile?

Old Judge Sir <Edward> Atkins remembred Dr. A. when he was a boy; he
lay at his father's house in Glocestershire: he kept his coach, which
was rare in those dayes. The Judge told me they then (vulgarly) called
it a _Quitch_. I have his originall picture. He had a delicate, quick,
lively and piercing black eie, fresh complexion, and a severe eie
browe. The figure in his monument at St. Paules is not like him, it is
too big.

_Heroum filii noxae_: he engrossed all the witt of the family, so that
none descended from him can pretend to any. 'Twas pitty that Dr. Fuller
had not mentioned him amongst his Worthys in that countie.

When he lay dyeing, he desired them to send for a _goodman_; they
thought he meant Dr. Goodman, deane of St. Paules, but he meant a
priest, as I have heard my cosen John Madock say. Capt. Pugh was wont
to say that civilians (as most learned an<d> gent.) naturally incline
to the church of Rome; and the common lawyers, as more ignorant and
clownish, to the church of Geneva.

Wilgiford, his relict, maried ... Browne, of Willey, in com. Surrey.

The inscription on his monument in St. Paul's church:--

    Gulielmo Aubreo clara familia in Breconia orto, LL. in Oxonia

[260]This Dr. W. Aubrey was related to the first William, earl of
Pembroke, two wayes (as appeares by comparing the old pedegre at Wilton
with that of the Aubreys); by Melin and Philip ap Elider (the Welsh
men are all kinne); and it is exceeding probable that the earle was
instrumentall in his rise. When the earl of Pembroke was generall
at St. Quintins in France, Dr. Aubrey was his judge advocat. In the
Doctor's will is mention of a great piece of silver plate, the bequest
of the right honᵇˡᵉ the earle of Pembroke.

... Stephens, the clarke of St. Benets, Paules Wharfe, tells me that
Dr. W. Aubrey gave xx_s._ per annum for ever to that parish.

[261]Vide the register of St. Benet's, Paule's Wharfe--quaere.
Stephens, the clark, sayeth that he gave xx_s._ per annum to the parish
of St. Benet's, Paule's wharfe, for ever: quaere.

[262]Sir Andrew Joyner of Bigods in Much Dunmow parish in Essex hath
two folios, stitcht, of manuscript letters of state, wherin are two
letters of Dr. William Aubrey's to secretary Walsingham, and also
lettres of queen Elizabeth's owne handwriting to Cecill; also _Liber
Stᵃᵉ Mariae de Reding_, a MS.; and other MSS.,--a long shelfe of
them--one of them writt tempore Henr. IV. This I had from Mr. Andrew
Paschal, rector of Chedzoy, Somerset.


<_Letter by Dr. W. Aubrey: supra, p. 59._>

  [263]MY GOOD COOSEN,

I have sente unto you again my yonge coosen[264] inclosede in a bagge,
as my wyffe cariethe yet one of myne; trustinge in God, that shortly
both, in theyr severall kyndes, shall come to lyght and live long, and
your's having _genium_, for ever. I knowe not, for lack of sufficiencie
of witte and learninge, how to judge of it at all. But in that shadowe
of judgemente that I have, truste me beinge vearie farre from meanynge
to yelde any thyng, to your owne eares, of yourselfe. The matter
dothe so strive with the manner of the handlinge that I am in dowpte
whyther I shall preferre the matter for the substance, weyght, and
pythines of the multitude of argumentes and reasones, or the manner
for the methode, order, perspicuitie, and elocution, in that height
and loftynesse that I did nott beleve our tonge (I meane the Englyshe)
to be capable of. Marie, our Brittishe, for the riches of the tonge,
in my affectionate opinion, is more copious and more advawntageable to
utter any thinge by a skillfull artificer. This navie which you aptlie,
accordinge to the nature and meaninge of your platt, call pettie, is so
sette furthe by you, thos principall and royall navies of the Grecianes
and Trojanes described by Homer and Vergill are no more bownde to them,
then it is to you.

You argue or rather thoondre so thicke and so strong for the necessitie
and commoditie of your navie, that you leade or rather drawe me
_obtorto collo_ to be of opinion with you, the benefitte therofe to be
suche as it wilbe a brydle and restreynte for conspiracies of foreyne
nationes, and of owre owne a salfegarde to merchants from infestationes
of pyrates; a readie meane to breed and augmente noombers of skillfull
marryners and sowldiers for the sea, a mayntynawnce in proces of tyme
for multitudes of woorthie men that otherwise wolde be ydle. Who can
denie, as you handle the matter, and as it is in trothe, but that
it will be a terror to all princes for attemptinge of any soodeyne
invasions,[265] and hable readilie to withstande any attempte foreyne
or domesticall by sea? And where this noble realme hath ben long
defamede for suffringe of pyrates disturbers of the common traffyke
upon these seas, yt will, as you trulye prove, utterlie extingwishe the
incorrigible, and occupie the reformed in that honourable service.

The indignitie that this realme hath long borne in the fyshinge rownde
aboute yt, with the intolerable injuries that owre nation hath indurede
and doe still, at strangers handes, besides the greatnes of the
commoditie that they take owte of our mowthes, hath ben, and is suche,
that the same almoste alone were cause sufficiente to furnishe your
navie if it may have that successe and consideration that it deserveth,
it will be a better wache for the securitie of the state than all the
intelligencers or becones that may be devisede: and a stronger wall
and bulwarke than either Calleys was, or a brase of such townes placed
in the most convenient parte of any continente of France, or the
Lowe-countrey. As her majestie of right is _totius orbis Britannici
domina, et lex maris_, whiche is given in the reste of the worlde by
Labro in our learning to Antoninus the Emperor, so she showlde have
the execution and effect therof in our worlde, yf your navie were
as well setled as you have plottede it. But what doe I by this bare
recitall deface your reasones so eloquentlie garnishede by you with the
furniture of so much and so sundrie lernynge? I will of purpose omitt
howe fully and howe substantially you confute the stronge objectiones
and argumentes that you inforce and presse againste your selfe. I wolde
God all men wolde as willinglie beare the light burdynes that you lay
upon them for the supportation of the chardges as you have wiselie and
reasonablie devisede the same. And so the dearthe and scarsitie that
curiouse or covetouse men may pretende to[266] feare, you so sowndlie
satisfie, that it is harde with any probabilitie to replie. As for
the sincere handlinge and govermente it is not to be disperede yf
the charge shall be with good ordinawnces and instructiones placede
carefullie in chosen persones of good credite and integritie. See howe
boldlie upon one soodeyne readinge I powre my opinion to your bosome of
this your notable and strange discowrse. And yet I will make bold to
censure it also as he dyd in the poore slipper when he was nott able
to fynd any faulte in any one parte of the workemanship of the noble
picture of that goddes. I pray you, Sir, seyinge you meane that your
navie shall contynewe in time of peace furnishede with your noombre
of men, what provision or ordre make you, howe they shall occupie and
exercise themselves all the while? Assure your selfe those whelpes of
yours neyther can nor will be ydle, and excepte it may please you
to prescribe unto them some good occupation and exercise, they will
occupie themselves in occupationes of their owne choice, wherof few
shall be to your lykinge or meanynge. Peradventure you meane of purpose
to reserve that to the consideration of the state. And where you in
vearie good proportion, lawierlike, share goodes taken by pyrates
amonge sundrie persones of your navie, and some portion to itselfe,
reservinge the moytie to the prince, you are to remembre that the same
are challenged holly to belong to her highnesse by prerogative. Let me
be also bold to offer to your consideration whether it be expedient
for you so freely to deale with the carryinge of ordinawnces out of
the realme beinge a matter lately pecuted[267] by the knowledge _et
convenientia_ of, etc. You doe, to veary great purpose inserte the
two orationes of Georgius Gemistus Plethon, the one to Emanuel by
fragments, and the other to his sonne Theodore _ad verbum_, for the
worthynes and varietye of many wise and sownd advises given by him to
those princes in a hard tyme, when they were in feare of that Turkish
conquest, that did after followe to the ruine of that empire of
Constantinople. However well doeth he handle the differences and rates
of customes and tributes, the moderate and sober use of apparell _in
ipsis principibus_! How wisely doethe[268] he condemne the takeinge
up of all the newe attires and apparell of strange nations, as though
he had written to us at this tyme, who doe offende as deepely therein
as the Greekes then dyd! How franke is he to his prince in useinge
the comparisone between the Eagle that hath no varietie of colours
of feathers, and yet of a princelie nature and estimation, and the
Peocock, a bird of no regall propertie nor credit yet glisteringe
angelically with varietie of feathers of all lively colours. There is
one sentence in the later oration which I have thought to note because
in apparence it dothe oppugne in a maner your treatise. The wordes are
these, _Prestat longè terrestribus copiis ac militum et ducum virtute,
quàm nautarum et similium hominum vilium arte, fiduciam ponere_.

Good coosen, pardon my boldnes. I doe this bicause you may understande
that I have roone over it. And yet was I abrode all the fowle day
yesterday. I pray you pardon me agayne for nott sendinge of it to you
accordinge to promisse. And for that your man is come, and for that I
have spente all my paper, I will no longer trowble you at this tyme,
savinge with my right heartie commendations to your selfe and to my
coosen your good mother from me and from my woman. From Kewe this
Soonday in the morninge, the 28 of July.

                    Yours assuredlie at commawndement,

                                                      W. AUBREY.

  To his verie lovinge coosen and assured
    freende Mr. John Dee, at Mortelake.


_Notes._

[AJ] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'in the 1 and 6, gules[269], a
chevron between 3 eagles heads erased or [Aubrey]; in the 2, ..., a
lion rampant ...; in the 3, ..., a chevron between 3 (lions'?) paws
...; in the 4, ..., three cocks gules; and in the 5, parted per pale
... and ..., 3 fleur-de-lys counter-changed.' The crest is 'an eagle's
head erased or [Aubrey].'

[AK] In MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 7, is the memorandum:--'Insert ♡ to Liber
B.'--'Liber B.' was a volume of antiquarian notes, collected by Aubrey,
now lost (Macray's _Annals of the Bodleian_, p. 367). Aubrey wanted
to copy into it something from this MS. ♡. Two other memoranda in the
same place are:--(_a_) 'William Aubrey, LL.D.: extract out of _De jure
feciali_, and _De legati deliquentis judice competente_, by Dr. Zouch,'
as is done _supra_, p. 58; (_b_) 'Memorandum the xx _s._ per annum
bread at St. Benet's, Paul's wharf'; see _supra_, p. 61.

Aubrey, in MS. Ballard 14, fol. 119, writing to Anthony Wood on Aug.
29, 1676, says:--'This day accidentally Mr. St. George shewed me
my grandfather, Dr. William Aubrey's, life in their office' <i.e.
the College of Arms>, 'written, I suppose, by Sir Daniel Dun, his
son-in-lawe. He came to Oxon at 14, and was LL. Dr. at 25.'

[AL] Aubrey was very enthusiastic about these notices of his
grandfather. Writing to Anthony Wood, on May 19, 1668 (MS. Wood F.
39, fol. 118), he says:--'My grandfather Dr. William Aubrey--Thuanus
in his _Annales_ makes an honourable mention of him, and also it
is set downe in the life of Mary, queen of Scotts (he being one of
the commissioners) that he was very jealous of her being putt to
death--which the chroniclers mention too I'me sure, and Stow. If you
would be pleased to turne to Thuanus and the life aforesaid you <would>
very much oblige me, and you shall have a payre of gloves, for his
sake.'

[AM] Edward Seymour, created earl of Hertford in 1559, had in 1553
married secretly Katherine, daughter of Henry Grey, duke of Suffolk.
In 1561 Elizabeth sent them prisoners to the Tower, and the marriage
was disputed in the law-courts. William Seymour, his grandson, who
succeeded as 2nd earl in 1621, married in 1610 Arabella Stuart. She was
sent prisoner to the Tower by James I: but Dr. W. Aubrey had died in
1595.

[AN] Aubrey, in MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 6ᵛ, has a note:--'Meredith Lloyd
respondet that Telesinus (Teliessen) was a British priest to whom
Gildas writes.'




=Francis Bacon= (1561-1626).


<_His coat of arms._>

[270]Quarterly, on the 1 and 4, gules on a chief argent two mullets
sable [Bacon], on the 2 and 3, barry of six or and azure, over all
a bend gules [ ...], a crescent on the fesse point for difference;
impaling, sable, a cross engrailed between 4 crescents argent, a
crescent sable on the fesse point [Barnham].


<_Miscellaneous Notes._>

[271]Chancellor Bacon:--The learned and great cardinal Richelieu was a
great admirer of the lord Bacon.

So was Monsieur Balzac: e.g. _les Oeuvres diverses_, dissertation sur
un tragedie, à Monsieur Huygens de Zuylichen, p. 158--'Croyons, pour
l'amour du chancilier Bacon, que toutes les folies des anciens sont
sages et tous leur songes mysteries.'

Quaere if I have inserted[272] his irrigation in the spring showres.

Vide _Court of King James_ by Sir Anthony Welden, where is an account
of his being viceroy here when the king was in Scotland, and gave
audience to ambassadors in the banquetting-house.

[273]Lord Chancellor Bacon:--Memorandum, this Oct. 1681, it rang over
all St. Albans that Sir Harbottle Grimston, Master of the Rolles, had
removed the coffin of this most renowned Lord Chancellour to make roome
for his owne to lye-in in the vault there at St. Michael's church.

[274]Sir Francis Bacon, knight, baron of Verulam and viscount of St.
Albans, and Lord High Chancellor of England:--vide his life writt by
Dr. William Rawley before _Baconi Resuscitatio_, in folio.


<_His admirers and acquaintances._>

It appeares by this following inscription that Mr. Jeremiah Betenham of
Graye's Inne was his lordship's intimate and dearely beloved friend.
This inscription is on the freeze of the summer house on the mount in
the upper garden of Grayes Inne, built by the Lord Chancellor Bacon.
The north side of the inscription is now perished[275]. The fane was a
Cupid drawing his bowe.

    Franciscus Bacon, Regis Solicitator Generalis, executor
    testamenti Jeremie Betenham nuper lectoris hujus hospitii,
    viri innocentis et abstinentis et contemplativi, hanc sedem in
    memoriam ejusdem Jeremie extruxit, anno Domini, 1609.

In his lordship's prosperity Sir Fulke Grevil, lord Brookes, was his
great friend and acquaintance; but when he was in disgrace and want,
he was so unworthy as to forbid his butler to let him have any more
small beer, which he had often sent for, his stomach being nice, and
the small beere of Grayes Inne not liking his pallet. This has donne
his memorie more dishonour then Sir Philip Sydney's friendship engraven
on his monument hath donne him honour. Vide ... History, and (I thinke)
Sir Anthony Weldon.

... Faucet, of Marybon in the county of Middlesex, esqr., was his
friend and acquaintance, as appeares by this letter which I copied
from his owne handwriting (an elegant Roman hand). 'Tis in the hands
of Walter Charlton, M.D., who begged it not long since of Mr. Faucet's
grandsonne.

[277]Richard[278], earle of Dorset, was a great admirer and friend
of the lord chancellor Bacon, and was wont to have Sir Thomas
Billingsley[279] along with him to remember and to putt-down in writing
my lord's sayings at table.

Edward, lord Herbert of Cherbery.

John Dun[280], dean of Paul's.

George Herbert.

Mr. Ben: Johnson was one of his friends and acquaintance, as doeth
appeare by his excellent verses on his lordship's birth-day in his
second volume, and in his _Underwoods_, where he gives him a character
and concludes that 'about his time, and within his view were borne all
the witts that could honour a nation or help studie.'

[281]Lord Bacon's birth-day: _Underwoods_, p. 222.

    Haile, happy genius of this ancient pile,
    How comes it all things so about thee smile?
    The fire, the wine, the men! and in the midst
    Thou stand'st as if some mysterie thou didst!
    Pardon, I read it in thy face, the day,
    For whose returnes, and many, all these pray:
    And so doe I. This is the sixtieth yeare
    Since Bacon, and my lord, was borne, and here,
    Sonne to the grave wise Keeper of the Seale,
    Fame and foundation of the English weale.
    What then his father was, that since is he,
    Now with a title more to the degree,
    England's High Chancellour, the destin'd heir
    In his soft cradle of his father's chaire,
    Whose even thred the Fates spinne round and full
    Out of their choysest and their whitest wooll.
      'Tis a brave cause of joy; let it be knowne,
    For 'twere a narrow gladnesse, kept thine owne.
    Give me a deep-crown'd bowle, that I may sing
    In raysing him the wisdome of my king.

_Discoveries_, p. 101.

    Yet there happened in my time one noble speaker[XII.] who
    was full of gravity in his speaking. His language (where he
    could spare or passe-by a jest) was nobly censorious. No man
    ever[282] spake more neatly, more pres<ent>ly, more weightily,
    or suffered lesse emptinesse, lesse idlenesse, in what he
    utter'd. No member of his speech but consisted of the owne
    graces: his hearers could not cough, or looke aside from
    him, without losse. He commanded where he spoke; and had his
    judges angry, and pleased, at his devotion. No man had their
    affections more in his power. The feare of every man that heard
    him was lest he should make an end.

    [XII.] Dominus Verulanus.

    Cicero is sayd to be the only wit that the people of Rome
    had, equall'd to their empire, _ingenium par imperio_. We had
    many, and in their severall ages (to take in but the former
    _seculum_) Sir Thomas Moore, the elder Wiat, Henry, earle of
    Surrey, Chaloner, Smith, Eliot, bishop Gardiner, were for
    their times admirable; Sir Nicholas Bacon was singular and
    almost alone in the beginning of queen Elizabeth's times; Sir
    Philip Sydney and Mr. Hooker (in different matter) grew great
    masters of wit and language and in whom all vigour of invention
    and strength of judgment met; the earle of Essex, noble and
    high; and Sir Walter Rawleigh, not to be contemn'd either
    for judgement or stile; Sir Henry Savile, grave and truly
    letter'd; Sir Edwin Sandys, excellent in both; lord Egerton,
    the Chancellour, a grave and great orator, and best when he
    was provoked; but his learned and able (though unfortunate)
    successor is he who hath fill'd up all numbers, and performed
    that in our tongue which may be compar'd or preferr'd either
    to insolent Greece or haughty Rome. In short, within his view,
    and about his times, were all the wits borne that could honour
    a language or helpe study. Now things dayly fall, wits grow
    downeward and eloquence growes backward, so that he may be
    nam'd and stand as the marke and ἀκμή of our language.

    I have ever observ'd it to have been the office of a wise
    patriot among the greatest affaires of the state to take care
    of the commonwealth of learning[283], for schooles they are
    the seminaries of state and nothing is worthier the study of a
    statesman then that part of the republick which wee call the
    advancement of letters. Witnesse the care of Julius Caesar, who
    in the heate of the civill warre writ his bookes of analogie
    and dedicated them to Tully. This made the lord St. Albans
    entitle his worke _Novum Organum_, which though by the most of
    superficiall men who cannot gett beyond the title of nominalls,
    it is not penetrated nor understood, it really openeth all
    defects of learning whatsoever, and is a booke

             Qui longum noto scriptori porriget aevum[284].

    My conceit of his person was never increased towards him by
    his place or honour, but I have and doe reverence him for the
    greatnesse that was only proper to himselfe in that he seem'd
    to me ever by his worke one of the greatest men and most worthy
    of admiration that have been in many ages. In his adversity I
    ever prayed that God would give him strength; for greatnes he
    could not want. Neither could I condole in a word or syllable
    for him, as knowing no accident could doe harme to vertue but
    rather helpe to make it manifest. #/

[285]He came often to Sir John Danvers at Chelsey. Sir John told me
that when his lordship had wrote the _History of Henry 7_, he sent
the manuscript copie to him to desire his opinion of it before 'twas
printed. Qd. Sir John 'Your lordship knowes that I am no scholar.'
''Tis no matter,' said my lord, 'I know what a schollar can say; I
would know what _you_ can[286] say.' Sir John read it, and gave his
opinion what he misliked which Tacitus did not omitt (which I am sorry
I have forgott) which my lord acknowledged to be true, and mended it:
'Why,' said he, 'a scholar would never have told me this.'

Mr. Thomas Hobbes (Malmesburiensis) was beloved by his lordship, who
was wont to have him walke with him in his delicate groves where he
did meditate: and when a notion darted into his mind, Mr. Hobbs was
presently to write it downe, and his lordship was wont to say that he
did it better then any one els about him; for that many times, when he
read their notes he scarce understood what they writt, because they
understood it not clearly themselves.

In short, all that were _great and good_ loved and honoured him.

Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chiefe Justice, alwayes envyed him, and would be
undervalueing his lawe, as you may find in my lord's lettres, and I
knew old lawyers that remembred it.


<_Personal characteristics._>

He was Lord Protector during King James's progresse into Scotland, and
gave audience in great state to ambassadors in the banquetting-house at
Whitehall.

His lordship would many times have musique in the next roome where he
meditated.

The aviary at Yorke-house was built by his lordship; it did cost
300_li._

At every meale, according to the season of the yeare, he had his table
strewed with sweet herbes and flowers, which he sayd did refresh his
spirits and memorie.

When his lordship was at his country house at Gorhambery, St. Albans
seemed as if the court were[287] there, so nobly did he live. His
servants had liveries with his crest (a boare ...); his watermen were
more imployed by gentlemen then any other, even the king's.

King James sent a buck to him, and he gave the keeper fifty pounds.

He was wont to say to his servant Hunt, (who was a notable thrifty man,
and loved this world, and the only servant he had that he could never
gett to become bound for him) 'The world was made for man, Hunt; and
not man for the world.' Hunt left an estate of 1000_li._ per annum in
Somerset.

None of his servants durst appeare before him without Spanish leather
bootes: for he would smell the neates-leather, which offended him.

The East India merchants presented his lordship with a cabinet of
jewells, which his page, Mr. Cockaine, recieved, and decieved his lord.

Three of his lordship's servants[XIII.] kept their coaches, and some
kept race-horses--vide Sir Anthony Welden's _Court of King James_.

[XIII.] Sir Thomas Meautys, Mr. <Thomas> Bushell, Mr. ... Idney.

[288]He was[289] a παιδεραστής. His Ganimeds and favourites tooke
bribes; but his lordship alwayes gave judgement _secundum aequum et
bonum_. His decrees in Chancery stand firme, i.e. there are fewer of
his decrees reverst then of any other Chancellor.

His dowager[290] maried her gentleman-usher, Sir (Thomas, I thinke)
Underhill, whom she made deafe and blind with too much of Venus. ☞ She
was living since the beheading of the late King.--Quaere where and when
she died.

He had a delicate[291], lively hazel eie; Dr. Harvey told me it was
like the eie of a viper.

I have now forgott what Mr. Bushell sayd, whether his lordship enjoyed
his Muse best at night, or in the morning.


<_His poems._>

His lordship was a good poet, but conceal'd, as appeares by his
letters. See excellent verses of his lordship's which Mr. Farnaby
translated into Greeke, and printed both[292] in his Ἀνθολογία, scil.

    The world's a bubble, and the life of man
            Less then a span, etc.

[293]Ἀνθολογία: Florilegium epigrammatum selectorum; Thomas Farnaby,
London, 1629, pag. 8.--'Huc elegantem viri clarissimi domini Verulamii
[293]παρῳδίαν adjicere adlubuit'--opposit to it on the other
page--'quam παρῳδίαν e nostrati bona nos Graecam qualemcunque sic
fecimus, et rhythmice.'

    The world's a bubble, and the life of man
            Lesse then a span;
    In his conception wretched, from the wombe
            So to the tombe;
    Curst from his cradle, and brought up to yeares
            With cares and feares.
    Who then to fraile mortality shall trust
    But limmes in water or but writes in dust.

    Yet since with sorrow here we live opprest,
            What life is best?
    Courts are but onely superficiall scholes
            To dandle fooles;
    The rurall parts are turn'd into a den
            Of savage men;
    And wher's a city from all vice so free,
    But may be term'd the worst of all the three?

    Domestick cares afflict the husband's bed
            Or paines his hed;
    Those that live single take it for a curse,
            Or doe things[294] worse;
    Some would have children; those that have them mone,
            Or wish them gone.
    What is it then to have, or have no wife,
    But single thraldome or a double strife?

    Our owne affections still at home to please
            Is a disease;
    To crosse the sea to any foreine soyle,
            Perills and toyle;
    Warres with their noise affright us; when they cease
            W'are worse in peace.
    What then remaines? but that we still should cry
    Not to be borne, or, being borne, to dye.

[296]_Apothegmata._

His lordship being in Yorke-house garden lookeing on fishers as they
were throwing their nett, asked them what they would take for their
draught; they answered _so much_: his lordship would offer them no more
but _so much_. They drew-up their nett, and <in> it were only 2 or 3
little fishes: his lordship then told them it had been better for them
to have taken his offer. They replied, they hoped to have had a better
draught; '_but_,' sayd his lordship, '_Hope is a good breakfast, but an
ill supper_.'

When his lordship was in dis-favour, his neighbours hearing how much he
was indebted, came to him with a motion to buy Oake-wood of him. His
lordship told them, '_He would not sell his feathers_.'

The earle of Manchester being removed from his place of Lord Chiefe
Justice of the Common Pleas[297] to be Lord President of the Councell,
told my lord (upon his fall) that he was sorry to see him made such an
example. Lord Bacon replied 'It did not trouble him since _he_ was made
_a President_.'

The bishop of London did cutt-downe a noble clowd of trees at Fulham.
The Lord Chancellor told him that he was _a good expounder of darke
places_.

Upon his being in dis-favour his servants suddenly went away; he
compared them to the flying of the vermin when the howse was falling.

One told his Lordship it was now time to looke about him. He replyed,
'I doe not looke _about_ me, I looke _above_ me.'

Sir Julius Cæsar (Master of the Rolles) sent to his lordship in his
necessity a hundred pounds for a present[XIV.]; quaere + de hoc of
Michael Malet.

[XIV.] Most of these enformations I have from Sir John Danvers.

His Lordship would often drinke a good draught of strong beer (March
beer) to-bedwards, to lay his working fancy asleep: which otherwise
would keepe him from sleeping great part of the night.

I remember Sir John Danvers told me, that his lordship much delighted
in his curious[298] garden at Chelsey, and as he was walking there
one time, he fell downe in a dead-sowne. My lady Danvers rubbed his
face, temples, etc. and gave him cordiall water: as soon as he came to
himselfe, sayd he, 'Madam, I am no good _footman_.'


<_His death and burial._>

[299]Mr. Hobbs told me that the cause of his lordship's death was
trying an experiment: viz., as he was taking the aire in a coach with
Dr. Witherborne (a Scotchman, Physitian to the King) towards High-gate,
snow lay on the ground, and it came into my lord's thoughts, why flesh
might not be preserved in snow, as in salt. They were resolved they
would try the experiment presently. They[300] alighted out of the
coach, and went into a poore woman's howse at the bottome of Highgate
hill, and bought a hen, and made the woman exenterate it, and then
stuffed the bodie with snow, and my lord did help to doe it himselfe.
The snow so chilled him, that he immediately fell so extremely ill,
that he could not returne to his lodgings (I suppose then at Graye's
Inne), but went to the earle of Arundell's house at High-gate, where
they putt him into a good bed warmed with a panne, but it was a damp
bed that had not been layn-in in about a yeare before, which gave him
such a cold that in 2 or 3 dayes, as I remember he[301] told me, he
dyed of suffocation.

Mr. George Herbert, Orator of the University of Cambridge, haz made
excellent verses on this great man. So haz Mr. Abraham Cowley in his
Pindariques. Mr. Thomas Randolph of Trin. Coll. in Cambr. haz in his
poems verses on him.

[302]In the north side of the chancell of St. Michael's church (which,
as I remember, is within the walles of Verulam) is the Lord Chancellor
Bacon's monument in white marble in a niech, as big as the life,
sitting in his chaire in his gowne and hatt cock't, leaning his head on
his right hand. Underneath is this inscription which they say was made
by his friend Sir Henry Wotton.

                  Franciscus Bacon, Baro de Verulam,

[XV.] His lordship's secretarie, who maried a kinswoman (<Anne> Bacon),
who is now the wife of Sir Harbottle Grimston, Master of the Rolles.


<_His relatives._>

[303]He had a uterine[XVI.] brother ANTHONY BACON, who was a very great
statesman and much beyond his brother Francis for the politiques, a
lame man, he was a pensioner to, and lived with ... earle of Essex. And
to him he dedicates the first edition of his Essayes, a little booke
no bigger then a primer, which I have seen in the Bodlyan Library.

[XVI.] His mother was <Anne> Cooke, sister of ... Cooke of Giddy-hall
in Essex, 2nd wife to Sir Nicholas Bacon.

His sisters were ingeniose and well-bred; they well understood the use
of the globes, as you may find in the preface of Mr. Blundevill of the
Sphaere: see if it is not dedicated to them. One of them was maried to
Sir John Cunstable of Yorkshire. To this brother in lawe he dedicates
his second edition of his Essayes, in 8vo; his last, in 4to, to the
duke of Bucks.

    [304]Blundevill's _Exercises_, preface:--'I began this
    arithmetique more then seven yeares since for that vertuous
    gentlewoman Mris Elizabeth Bacon, the daughter of Sir Nicholas
    Bacon, knight (a man of most excellent witt and of a most
    deep judgement and sometimes Lord Keeper of the great seale
    of England), and lately the loving and faithfull wife of my
    worshipfull friend Mr. Justice Windham, who for his integrity
    of life and for his wisdome and justice dayly shewed in
    government and also for his good hospitalitie deserved great
    commendation; and though at her request I had made this
    arithmetique so plaine and easie as was possible (as to my
    seeming) yet her continuall sicknesse would not suffer her to
    exercise herself therin.'


<_His residences._>

[305]I will write something of Verulam, and his house at Gorhambery.

At Verulam is to be seen, in some few places, some remaines of the
wall of this citie[XVII.]; which was in compass about ... miles. This
magnanimous Lord Chancellor had a great mind to have made it a citie
again: and he had designed it, to be built with great uniformity: but
Fortune denyed it him, though she proved kinder <to> the great Cardinal
Richelieu, who lived both to designe and finish that specious towne of
Richelieu, where he was borne; before, an obscure and small vilage.
(The ichnographie, etc., of this towne and palais is nobly engraved).

[XVII.] Verolamium, Virolamium, Cassivelani oppidum.

Within the bounds of the walls of this old citie of Verulam (his
lordship's Baronry) was Verulam howse, about 1/2 a mile from St.
Albans; which his Lordship built, the most ingeniosely contrived little
pile[XVIII.], that ever I sawe. No question but his lordship was the
chiefest architect; but he had for his assistant a favourite of his
(a St. Albans man) Mr. ... Dobson (who was his lordship's right hand)
a very ingeniose person (Master of the Alienation Office); but he
spending his estate upon woemen[306], necessity forced his son William
Dobson to be the most excellent painter that England hath yet bred, qui
obiit Oct. 1648; sepult. S. Martin's in the fields[307].

[XVIII.] I am sorry I measured not the front and breadth; but I little
suspected it would be pulled downe for the sale of the materialls.

[308]The view of this howse from the entrance into the gate by the
high-way is thus. The parallel[309] sides answer one another. I doe not
well remember if on the east side were bay windowes, which his lordship
much affected, as may be seen in his essay _Of Building_. Quaere
whether the number of windowes on the east side were 5 or 7: to my best
remembrance but 5. This model I drew by memorie, 1656.


VERULAM HOWSE[310].

This howse did cost nine or ten thousand the building, and was
sold about 1665 or 1666 by Sir Harbottle Grimston, baronet, (now
Master of the Rolles) to two carpenters for fower hundred poundes;
of which they made eight hundred poundes. Memorandum:--there were
good chimney-pieces; the roomes very loftie, and all were very well
wainscotted. Memorandum:--there were two bathing-roomes or stuffes,
whither his Lordship retired afternoons as he sawe cause. All the
tunnells of the chimneys were carried into the middle of the howse,
as in this draught; and round about them were seates. The top of
the howse was well leaded. From the leads was a lovely prospect to
the ponds, which were opposite to the east side of the howse, and
were on the other side of the stately walke of trees that leades to
Gorhambery-howse: and also over that long walke of trees, whose topps
afford a most pleasant[311] variegated verdure, resembling the workes
in Irish-stitch. The kitchin, larder, cellars, &c., are under ground.
In the middle of this howse was a delicate staire-case of wood, which
was curiously carved, and on the posts of every interstice was some
prettie figure, as of a grave divine with his booke and spectacles, a
mendicant friar, &c.--(not one thing twice). Memorandum:--on the dores
of the upper storie on the outside (which were painted darke umber)
were the figures of the gods of the Gentiles (viz. on the south dore,
2d storie, was Apollo; on another, Jupiter with his thunderbolt, etc.)
bigger then the life, and donne by an excellent hand; the heightnings
were of hatchings of gold, which when the sun shone on them made a most
glorious shew.

Memorandum:--the upper part of the uppermost dore, on the east side,
had inserted into it a large looking-glasse, with which the stranger
was very gratefully decieved, for (after he had been entertained a
pretty while, with the prospects of the ponds, walks, and countrey,
which this dore faced) when you were about to returne into the
roome[312], one would have sworn _primo intuitu_, that he had beheld
another prospect through the howse: for, as soon as the stranger was
landed on the balconie, the conserge[313] that shewed the howse would
shutt the dore to putt this fallacy on him with the looking-glasse.
This was his lordship's summer-howse: for he sayes (in his essay) one
should have seates for summer and winter as well as cloathes.

From hence to Gorhambery is about a little mile, the way easily
ascending, hardly so acclive as a deske.

From hence to Gorambury in a straite line leade three parallell walkes:
in the middlemost three coaches may passe abreast: in the wing-walkes
two may. They consist of severall stately trees of the like groweth
and heighth, viz. elme, chesnut, beach, hornebeame, Spanish-ash,
cervice-tree, &c., whose topps (as aforesaid) doe afford from the walke
on the howse the finest shew that I have seen, and I sawe it about
Michaelmas, at which time of the yeare the colour of leaves are most
varied. The manner of the walke is thus:--

[314]The figures of the ponds were thus: they were pitched at the
bottomes with pebbles of severall colours, which were work't in to
severall figures, as of fishes, &c. which in his lordship's time were
plainly to be seen through the cleare water, now over-grown with
flagges and rushe.

If a poor bodie had brought his lordship halfe a dozen pebbles of a
curious colour, he would give them a shilling, so curious was he in
perfecting his fish-ponds, which I guesse doe containe four acres.
In the middle of the middlemost pond, in the island, is a curious
banquetting-house of Roman architecture, paved with black and white
marble; covered with Cornish slatt, and neatly wainscotted.

Memorandum:--about the mid-way from Verolam-house to Gorambery, on the
right hand, on the side of a hill which faces the passer-by, are sett
in artificiall manner the afore-named trees, whose diversity of greens
on the side of the hill are exceeding pleasant. These delicate walkes
and prospects entertaine the eie to Gorambery-howse, which is a large,
well-built Gothique howse, built (I thinke) by Sir Nicholas Bacon,
Lord Keeper, father to this Lord Chancellor, to whom it descended
by the death of Anthony Bacon, his middle brother, who died sans
issue.[315]The Lord Chancellor made an addition of a noble portico,
which fronts the garden to the south: opposite to every arch of this
portico, and as big as the arch, are drawen, by an excellent hand
(but the mischief of it is, in water-colours), curious pictures, all
emblematicall, with mottos under each: for example, one I remember is
a ship tossed in a storme, the motto, _Alter erit tum Tiphys_. Enquire
for the rest.

Over this portico is a stately gallerie, whose glasse-windowes are
all painted; and every pane with severall figures of beast, bird, or
flower: perhaps his lordship might use them as topiques for locall
memory. The windowes looke into the garden, the side opposite to them
no window, but that side is hung all with pictures at length, as of
King James, his lordship, and severall illustrious persons of his time.
At the end you enter is no windowe, but there is a very large picture,
thus:--in the middle on a rock in the sea stands King James in armour,
with his regall ornaments; on his right hand stands (but whither or no
on a rock I have forgott), King Henry 4 of France, in armour; and on
his left hand, the King of Spaine, in like manner. These figures are
(at least) as big as the life, they are donne only with umbre and shell
gold: all the heightning and illuminated part being burnisht gold,
and the shadowed umbre, as in the pictures of the gods on the dores
of Verolam-house. The roofe of this gallerie is semi-cylindrique, and
painted by the same hand and same manner, with heads and busts of Greek
and Roman emperours and heroes.

In the hall (which is of the auncient building) is a large storie very
well painted of the feastes of the gods, where Mars is caught in a
nett by Vulcan. On the wall, over the chimney, is painted an oake with
akornes falling from it; the word, _Nisi quid potius_. And on the wall,
over the table, is painted Ceres teaching the soweing of corne; the
word, _Moniti meliora_.

The garden is large, which was (no doubt) rarely planted and kept in
his lordship's time: vide vitam Peireskii de domino Bacon. Here is a
handsome dore, which opens into Oake-wood; over this dore in golden
letters on blew are these six verses[316].

[317]The oakes of this wood are very great and shadie. His lordship
much delighted himselfe here: under every tree he planted some fine
flower, or flowers, some wherof are there still (1656), viz. paeonies,
tulips,....

From this wood a dore opens into ..., a place as big as an ordinary
parke, the west part wherof is coppice-wood, where are walkes cutt-out
as straight as a line, and broade enoug for a coach, a quarter of
a mile long or better.--Here his lordship much[318] meditated, his
servant Mr. Bushell attending him with his pen and inke horne to
sett downe his present notions.--Mr. Thomas Hobbes told me, that his
lordship would employ him often in this service whilest he was there,
and was better pleased with his _minutes_, or notes sett downe by him,
then by others who did not well understand his lordship. He told me
that he was employed in translating part of the Essayes, viz. three of
them, one wherof was that of the Greatnesse of Cities, the other two I
have now forgott.

The east of this parquet (which extends to Veralam-howse) was
heretofore, in his lordship's prosperitie, a paradise; now is a large
ploughed field. This eastern division consisted of severall parts; some
thicketts of plumme-trees with delicate walkes; some of rasberies. Here
was all manner of fruit-trees that would grow in England; and a great
number of choice forest-trees; as the whitti-tree, sorbe-, cervice-,
etc., eugh[319]. The walke<s>, both in the coppices and other boscages,
were most ingeniosely designed: at severall good viewes[320], were
erected elegant sommer-howses well built of Roman architecture, well
wainscotted and cieled; yet standing, but defaced, so that one would
have thought the Barbarians had made a conquest here. This place in his
lordship's time was a sanctuary for phesants, partridges, etc. birds
of severall kinds and countries, as white, speckled etc., partridges.
In April, and the springtime, his lordship would, when it rayned, take
his coach (open) to recieve the benefit of irrigation, which he was
wont to say was very wholsome because of the nitre in the aire and the
_universall spirit of the world_.

His lordship was wont to say, _I will lay my mannor of Gorambery on't_,
to which Judge ... made a spightfull reply, saying he would not hold a
wager against that, but against _any other_ mannour of his lordship's
he would. Now this illustrious Lord Chancellor had only this mannor of
Gorambery.




=Roger Bacon= (1214-1294).


[321]Roger Bacon, friar ordinis <S. Francisci>:--Memorandum, in Mr.
Selden's learned verses before Hopton's _Concordance of yeares_, he
speakes of friar Bacon, and sayes that he was a Dorsetshire gentleman.
There are yet of that name in that countie, and some of pretty good
estate. I find by ... (which booke I have) that he understood the
making of optique glasses; where he also gives a perfect account of the
making of gunpowder, vide pag ... ejusdem libri.

[322]Friar Roger Bacon:--Dr. Gerard Langbain had a Catalogue[AO] of all
his workes, which Catalogue Dr. <Thomas> Gale, schoolmaster of Paule's,

_Note._

[AO] The reference is probably to a list of pieces by Roger Bacon which
were found among Thomas Allen's MSS. Langbaine's draft of it is found
in MS. Langbaine 7, p. 393: see Clark's Wood's _Life and Times_, iv.
253.

=Edward Bagshaw= (1629-1671).


[325]Edward Bagshaw was borne at Broughton in Northamptonshire; 42 when
he dyed--from his widowe[AP].

[326]My old acquaintance, Mr. Edward Bagshawe, B.D., 3rd son of Edward
Bagshawe, esq., a bencher of the Middle Temple, was borne (the day nor
moneth certaine to be knowne) November or December at Broughton in
Northamptonshire, where Mr. Boldon[327], quondam Coll. Aeneinas., was
parson.

He was a king's scholar at Westminster schole, then student of Christ
Church. Scripsit severall treatises.

Obiit on St. Innocents day, 28 Dec., 1671, in Tuttle street,
Westminster, a prisoner to Newgate 22 weekes for running into a
praemunire for refusing to take the oath of allegiance (he boggled at
the word 'willingly' in the oath): aetatis 42. Sepult., Newyeares day,
in the fanatique burying-place by the Artillery-ground in Moorfields,
where his sorrowfull widdowe will place his epitaph.

1500 or 2000 people were at his funerall.

[328]'Here[329] lyes interred | the body of | Mr. Edward Bagshaw |
minister of the Gospell | who recieved from God | faith to embrace it
| courage to defend it | and patience to suffer for it | when by most

=Richard Bancroft= (1544-1610).


    In MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 119ᵛ, is this jotting:--

    'Dr. Mat. Skinner. _Resp._ 'tis archbishop Bancroft's
    picture--quod N.B., and inscribe.'

    This is probably to be interpreted as meaning--'Enquire
    whether the portrait,' in a certain place, 'is that of Dr.
    Matthew Skinner.' Finding that it is the portrait of Richard
    Bancroft, 'see that the name is inscribed on it,' for future
    identification.




=John Barclay= (1582-1621).

=Robert Barclay= (1648-1690).


[331]Johannes Barclaius, Scoto-Britannus:--from Sam. Butler--was in
England some time tempore regis Jacobi. He was then an old man, white
beard; and wore a hatt and a feather, which gave some severe people
offence.

Dr. John Pell tells me, that his last employment was Library-Keeper of
the Vatican, and that he was there poysoned.

Memorandum:--this John Barclay haz a sonne[332], now (1688) an old man,
and a learned quaker, who wrote a Systeme of the Quakers' Doctrine in
Latine[333], dedicated to King Charles II, now <to> King James II; now
translated by him into English, in.... The Quakers mightily value him.
The booke is common.




=Isaac Barrow= (1630-1677).


[334]Isaac Barrow, D.D.--from his father, (who was borne Aprill 22,
1600, 1/2 a yeare older then King Charles 1st), May 17, 1682.

His father, Thomas Barrow, was the second son of Isaac Barrow of
Spinney Abbey in the countie of Cambridge, esq., who was a Justice
of the Peace there above fourtie yeares. The father of Thomas never
designed him for a tradesman, but he was so severe to him <that>
he could not endure to live with him and so came to London and was
apprentice to a linnen-draper. He kept shop at the signe of the
White-horse in Forster lane near St. Forster's church in St. Leonard's
parish; and <his son[335]> was christened at St. John Zacharie's in
Forster lane, for at that time St. Leonard's church was pulled downe
to be re-edified. He was borne anno Dni 1630 in October[336] after
King Charles IIⁿᵈ. Dr. Isaac Barrow had the exact day and hower of
his father, which may be found amongst his papers. His father sett it
downe in his English bible, a faire one, which they used at the king's
chapell when he was in France and he could not get it again. His father
travelled with the King, Charles 2ⁿᵈ, where ever he went; he was sealer
to the Lord Chancellor beyond sea, and so when he came into England.
Amongst Dr. Barrowe's papers it may be found. Dr. Tillotson has all his
papers--quaere for it, and for the names of all writings both in print
and MSS.

He went to schoole, first to Mr. Brookes at Charterhouse two yeares.
His father gave to Mr. Brookes 4 _li._ per annum, wheras his pay was
but 2 _li._, to be carefull of him; but Mr. Brokes was negligent
of him, which the captain of the school acquainted his father (his
kinsman) and sayd that he would not have him stay there any longer than
he[337] did, for that he[337] instructed him.

Afterwards to one Mr. Holbitch, about fower years, at Felton[338] in
Essex; from whence he was admitted of Peterhouse College in Cambridge
first, and went to schoole a yeare after. Then he was admitted of
Trinity College in Cambridge at 13 yeares old.

Quaere whose daughter his mother was.

His mother was Anne, daughter of William Buggin of North Cray in Kent,
esq. She died when her sonne Isaac was about fower yeares old.

Anno Domini ... he travelled, and returned, anno Domini....

He wrote.... What MSS.?--quaere Dr. Tillotson, and quaere Mr. Brabazon
Aylmer, bookseller, nere Exchange Alley.

His humour when a boy and after:--merry and cheerfull and beloved where
ever he came. His grandfather kept him till he was 7 years old: his
father was faine to force him away, for there he would have been good
for nothing there.

A good poet, English and Latin. He spake 8 severall languages.

[339]His father dealt in his trade to Ireland where he had a great
losse, neer 1000 _li._; upon which he wrote to Mr. Holbitch, a Puritan,
to be pleased to take a little paines more than ordinary with him,
because the times growing so bad, and such a losse then received, that
he did not knowe how he might be able to provide for him, and so Mr.
Holbitch tooke him away from the howse where he was boarded to his owne
howse, and made him tutor to my lord viscount Fairfax, ward to the lord
viscount Say and Seale, where he continued so long as my lord continued.

This viscount Fairfax[340] died a young man. This viscount Fairfax,
being a schooleboy, maried a gentleman's daughter in the towne there,
who had but a thousand pounds. So leaving the schoole, would needs have
Mr. Isaac Barrow with him, and told him he would maintaine him. But the
lord Say was so cruel to him that he would not allow anything that 'tis
thought he dyed for want. The 1000 _li._ could not serve him long.

During this time old Mr. Thomas Barrow was shutt-up at Oxford and could
not heare of his sonne. But young Isaac's master, Holbitch, found him
out in London and courted him to come to his schoole and that he would
make him his heire. But he did not care to goe to schoole again.

When my lord Fairfax faild and that he sawe he grew heavy upon him,
he went to see one of his schoolfellowes, one Mr. Walpole, a Norfolke
gent., who asked him 'What he would doe?' He replyed he 'knew not
what to doe; he could not goe to his father at Oxford.' Mr. Walpole
then told him 'I am goeing to Cambridge to Trinity College and I
will maintaine you there'; and so he did for halfe a yeare till the
surrender of Oxford; and then his father enquired after him and found
him at Cambridge. And the very next day after old Mr. Barrow came to
Cambridge, Mr. Walpole was leaving the University and (hearing nothing
of Isaac's father) resolved to take Isaac along with him to his howse.
His father then asked him what profession he would be of, a merchant
or etc.? He begd of his father to lett him continue in the University.
His father then asked what would maintain him. He told him 20 _li._
per annum: 'I warrant you,' sayd he, 'I will maintaine myselfe with
it.' His father replyed 'I'le make a shift to allow you that.' So his
father then went to his tutor and acquainted him of, etc. His tutor,
Dr. Duport, told him that he would take nothing for his reading to him,
for that he was likely to make a brave scholar, and he would helpe him
to halfe a chamber for nothing. And the next newes his father heard of
him was that he was chosen in to the howse.[341]Dr. Hill[342] was then
master of the college. He mett Isaac[343] one day and layd his hand
upon his head and sayd 'thou art a good boy; 'tis pitty that thou art a
cavalier.'

He was a strong and a stowt man and feared not any man. He would fight
with the butchers' boyes in St. Nicholas' shambles, and be hard enough
for any of them.

He went to travell 3 or 4 yeares after the king was beheaded, upon the
colledge account[344]. He was a candidate for the Greeke professor's
place, and had the consent of the University but Oliver Cromwell putt
in Dr. Widrington[345]; and then he travelled.

He was abroad 5 yeares[346], viz. in Italie, France, Germany,
Constantinople.

As he went to Constantinople, two men of warre (Turkish shippes)
attacqued the vessell wherin he was. In which engagement he shewed
much valour in defending the vessell; which the men that were in that
engagement often testifye, for he never told his father of it himselfe.

Upon his returne, he came in <a> ship to Venice, which was stowed with
cotton-wooll, and as soon as ever they came on shore the ship fell on
fire, and was utterly consumed, and not a man lost, but not any goods
saved--a wonderfull preservation.

His personall valour--At Constantinople, being in company with the
English merchants, there was a Rhadamontade that would fight with any
man and bragged of his valour, and dared any man there to try him. So
no man accepting his challenge, said Isaac (not then a divine), 'Why,
if none els will try you I will'; and fell upon him and chastised him
handsomely that he vaunted no more amongst them.

After he had been 3 years beyond sea, his correspondent dyed, so that
he had no more supply; yet he was so well beloved that he never wanted.

At Constantinople he wayted on the consul Sir Thomas Bendish, who made
him stay with him and kept him there a yeare and a halfe, whether he
would or no.

At Constantinople, Mr. Dawes (afterwards Sir Jonathan Dawes, who dyed
sherif of London), a Turkey merchant, desired Mr. Barrow to stay but
such a time and he would returne with him, but when that time came
he could not goe, some businesse stayd him. Mr. Barrow could stay no
longer; so Mr. Dawes would have had Mr. Barrow have C[347] pistolles.
'No,' said Mr. Barrow, 'I know not whether I shall be able to pay you.'
''Tis no matter,' said Mr. Dawes. To be short, forced him to take fifty
pistolls, which at his returne he payd him again.

[348]Memorandum, his pill (an opiate, possibly Matthews his pil),
which he was wont to take in Turkey, which was wont to doe him good,
but he tooke it preposterously at Mr. Wilson's, the sadler's, neer
Suffolke-house, where he was wont to lye and where he dyed, and 'twas
the cause of his death--quaere + de hoc there.

As he lay expiring[349] in the agonie of death, the standers-by could
heare him say softly 'I have seen the glories of the world'--<from> Mr.
Wilson.

I have heard Mr. Wilson say that when he was at study, was so intent at
it that when the bed was made, or so, he heeded it not nor perceived
it, was so _totus in hoc_; and would sometimes be goeing out without
his hatt on.

He was by no meanes a spruce man[350], but most negligent in his
dresse. As he was walking one day in St. James's parke, looking ...,
his hatt up, his cloake halfe on and halfe off, a gent. came behind him
and clapt him on the shoulder and sayd 'Well, goe thy wayes for the
veriest scholar that ever I[351] mett with.'

He was a strong man but pale as the candle he studyed by.

His stature was....

chambers, and see what they were studying; and Charles Scarborough's
genius let him to the mathematics, and he was wont to be reading of
Clavius upon Euclid. The old Dr. had found in the title '... ..., _e
Societate Jesu_,' and was much scandalized at it. Sayd he, 'By all
meanes leave-off this author, and read Protestant mathematicall bookes.'

One sent this Doctor a pidgeon-pye from New-market or thereabout, and

=Francis Beaumont= (1584-1616).


[361]Mr. Francis Beaumont was the son of Judge Beaumont[362]. There
was a wonderfull consimility of phansey[XIX.] between him and Mr. John
Fletcher, which caused that dearnesse of frendship between them.

[XIX.]

    Consentit astrum.

                                        HORACE, lib. 2, ode 17.



I thinke they were both of Queen's College in Cambridge.

I have heard Dr. John Earles (since bishop of Sarum), who knew them,
say that his maine businesse was to correct the overflowings[364] of
Mr. Fletcher's witt.

They lived together on the Banke side, not far from the Play-house,
both batchelors; lay together--from Sir James Hales, etc.; had one
wench in the house between them, which they did so admire; the same
cloathes and cloake, &c., betweene them.

He writt (amongst many other) an admirable elegie on the countesse of
Rutland, which is printed with verses before Sir Thomas Overburie's
_Characters_. John Earles, in his verses on him, speaking of them,

    'A monument that will then lasting bee,
    When all her marble is more dust then shee.'

Ex registro:--he was buryed at the entrance of St. Benedict's chapell
where <is> the earl of Middlesex' monument, in Westminster Abbey, March
9, 1615/6[XX.].

[XX.] Memorandum:--Isaac Casaubon was buryed at the entrance of the
same chapell. He dyed July 8, 1614.

I searched, severall yeares since, in the Register-booke of St. Mary
Overies, for the obiit of Mr. John Fletcher, which I sent to Mr.
Anthony à Wood.

He hath a very good prefatory letter before Mr. Speght's edition of Sir
Geofrey Chaucer's Workes printed by Adam Islip, 1602, London, where he
haz judicious observations of his writing.

[366]Did I tell you that I have mett with old Mr ...[367] who knew all
the old English poets, whose lives I am taking from him: his father
was master of the ... play-house.

[368]The more to be admired, quaere--he was not a company keeper; lived
in Shorditch; would not be debauched; and if invited to court, was in
paine.

=Richard Benese= (14..-1546).


[370]I did see, many yeares since, in a countrey-man's house, a little
booke in 8vo in English, called

                   Arsmetrie, or the Art of numbring:

printed in an old black letter about Henry VIII. The author's name I
doe not remember--quaere in Duck lane.

       *       *       *       *       *

The next old mathematicall booke in English that I have seen hath this
title, viz:--

This booke sheweth the manner of measuring of all manner of land, as
well of woodland as of lande in the felde, and comptinge the true
nombre of acres of the same.

                                   ✠

=Henry Billingsley= (15..-1606).


[381]Sir Henry Billingsley[AQ], knight.--On the north side of the
chancell of St. Katharine Coleman church London at the upper end is
this inscription, viz:--

    Here lieth buried the body of Elizabeth, late the wife of Henry
    Billingsley, one of the Queene's majestie's customers of her
    port of London, who dyed the 29th day of July in the yeare of
    our Lord God 1577.

                           _In obitum ejus._

    Stat sua cuique dies atque ultima funeris hora
      Cum Deus hinc et mors invidiosa vocant;
    Nec tibi nec pietas tua vel forma, Elizabetha,
      Praesidium leto[382] ne trahereris erat.
    Occidis exactis ternis cum conjuge lustris,
      At septem vitae lustra fuere tuae.

Memorandum:--Billingsley (a village) is in the countie of Salop. 'Tis a
Shropshire familie; but the village now is one Mr. Norton's.

This Sir Henry Billingsley was one of the learnedst citizens that
London has bred. This was he that putt forth all Euclid's Elements in
English with learned notes and preface of Mr. John Dee, and learned men
say 'tis the best Euclid. He had been sheriff and Lord Mayor of the
city of London. His howse was the faire howse in Fenchurch street where
now Jacob Luce lives, a merchant, of of whom quaere +. Vide in Fuller's
Worthies and Stowe's Survey. His Euclid was printed at London by John
Day, 1570.

'The Translator to the Reader--Wherfore considering the want and lack
of such good authors hitherto in our English tongue, lamenting also
the negligence and lacke of zeale to their countrey in those of our
nation to whom God hath given both knowledge and also abilitie to
translate into our tongue and to publish abroad such good authors and
bookes: Seeing moreover that many good witts, both of gentlemen and
others of all degrees, much desirous and studious of these artes,--I
have for their sakes with some chardge and great travaile faithfully
translated into our vulgar tounge and set abroad in print this booke
of Euclid wherunto I have added plaine declarations and examples,
manifold additions, scholies, annotations, and inventions which I have
gathered.'--He promises (here) some more translations and sayes that in
religion he hath alreadie don, quaere.

Memorandum P. Ramus in his Scholia's sayes that the reason why
mathematiques did most flourish in Germanie was that the best authors
were rendred into their mother tongue, and that publique lectures of it
were also read in their owne tongue--quod nota bene.

Memorandum when I was a boy, one Sir ... Billingsley had a very
pleasant seate with a faire[383] oake-wood adjoyning to it, about a
mile 1/2[384] east of Bristoll--quaere if[385], etc.

Vide de Sir Thomas Billingsley, pag. <44b>[386]; who was gentleman of
the horse to Richard, earl of Dorset. He managed the great horse best
of any man in England. He taught the Prince Elector and brothers to
ride. Quaere if descended hence.

In those dayes[387] merchants travelled much abroad into Italie,
Spaine, etc. Quaere Mr. Abraham Hill of what company he was. Probably
good memorialls may be there found of his generous and publique spirit.
_Respondet_:--He was of the Goldsmiths' Company, where is a good
picture of him.

R. B., i.e. Robert[388] Billingsley, teaches Arithmetique and
Mathematiques at ... in.... He hath printed a very pretty little
booke of arithmetique and algebra, London (scilicet, _<The> Idea of
Arithmetic_): was Sir Henry's great grandson--from Mr. Abraham Hill,
Regiae Societatis Socius.

[389]In the table of benefactors in the church of St. Catherine Colman,
viz.--

  '1603 {Dame Elizabeth} Billingsley did will to the poor 1_s._ per
        {Sir Henry     }

weeke for ever and 200_li._ which their heires etc. have not payd'--

The minister here, Mr. Dodson, sayes that it was not payd because the
parish did not find-out in due time land to make a purchase of.

Many yeares since Mr. Abraham Hill, Regiae Societatis Socius, citizen,
told me that Sir Henry Billingsley was of the Goldsmiths' Company, and
that his picture was in Goldsmiths' Hall, which I went lately to see.
No picture of him, and besides the clarke of the Company told me that
he is sure _he_ was never of that Company. But Mr. Hill tells me since
that in Stowe's Survey you may see of what Company all the Lord Mayers
were, which see[390] and tell me.

[391]Sir H. Billingsley--Mr. Leeke, mathematician, saith that he was of
the company of goldsmiths, quaere. Quaere the clarke of the company:
vide register booke. Vide Heralds' Office (Salop, and neer Bristowe).
Vide Fuller's Worthyes where he mentions the Lord Mayers.

[392]_Ex registro_ <of St. Catherine Coleman>:--Sir Henry Billingsley,
knight, buried in the vault under his pewe in the church of St.
Catherine Coleman, London, December the 18th, 1606. I find by the
register that he had two more wives besides Elizabeth mentioned in the
inscription; his second was the lady Trapps; third,....

Memorandum his house (which is a very faire one), which is neer the
church, is still remayning untoucht by the fire. In the parlour
windowe are scutchions of his family, which gett. There now lives Mr.
Lucy[393], a great merchant.

He was sheriff of the citie of London anno Domini <1584>, reginae
Elizabethae 26; he was Lord Mayor of the city of London anno Domini
<1596>, reginae Elizabethae 38--Sir Thomas Skinner served one part
and Sir Henry Billingsley the other:--Baker's Chronicle, reigne queen

[397]Sir Henry Billingsley<'s life is> already donne[398]. Friar
Whitehead[AR], of Austin Friars (now Wadham College), did instruct him.
He kept him at his house and there I thinke he dyed.


_Notes._

[AQ] Aubrey gives in colour this very elaborate coat:--'quarterly in
the 1 and 4, gules, a fleur-de-lys or, a canton of the second; in the
2, ..., on a cross between four lions rampant 5 mullets ...; in the 3,
per saltire or and azure two birds (? martlets); _impaling_, quarterly,
in the 1 and 4, azure 2 lions passant in pale or; in the 2, or, a fess
sable, 2 mullets in chief gules; in the 3, barry of six argent and
gules a bend sable and a canton gules.'

[AR] See Clark's Wood's _City of Oxford_, ii. 454, 471. It is suggested
that Billingsley in his Euclid published Whitehead's papers as his own.




=Martin Billingsley.=


[399]Mr. Martin Billingsley (captain <Edward> Shirburne knew him) was a
writing master in London. He printed an excellent copie-booke (quaere
if he descended from this[400]): vide his scutcheon[401] above his
picture before his booke.

[402]Martin Billingsley, who made the copie booke, 1623, port.[403] ut
in margine, '..., a cross between 4 lions rampant ..., 5 mullets ... on
the cross.'




=Richard Billingsley.=


[404]Richard Billingsley[405] scripsit:--

'An Idea of Arithmetick, at first designed for the use of the
free-schoole at Thurlow in Suffolk, by R. B. schoolmaster there':
stitch't 8vo, 3 sheetes, London, 'printed by J. Flesher, and are to be
sold by W. Morden booke-seller in Cambridge, 1655.'




=Thomas Billingsley= (obiit 167..).


[406]Sir Thomas Billingsley was the best horseman in England, and out
of England no man exceeded him.

He taught this[407] earle <of Dorset> and his 30 gentlemen to ride the
great horse. He taught this[408] Prince Elector Palatine of the Rhine
and his brothers.

He ended his dayes at the countesse of Thanet's (daughter and co-heire
of Richard, earl of Dorset) ... 167-; dyed praying on his knees.




=John Birkenhead= (1615-1679).


[409]Sir John Birkenhead, knight, was borne at Nantwych[410] in
Cheshire. His father was a sadler there, and he had a brother a sadler,
a trooper in Sir Thomas Ashton's regiment, who was quartered at my
father's, who told me so.

He went to Oxford university at ... old, and was first a servitor of
Oriall colledge: vide _Antiq. Oxon._[411] Mr. Gwin[412], minister of
Wilton, was his contemporary there, who told me he wrote an excellent
hand, and, in 163[7 or 8] when William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury,
was last there, he had occasion to have some things well transcribed,
and this Birkenhead was recommended to him, who performed[413] his
businesse so well, that the archbishop recommended him to All Soules'
college to be a fellow, and he was accordingly elected[414]. He was
scholar enough, and a poet.

After Edgehill fight, when King Charles I first had his court at
Oxford, he was pitched upon as one fitt to write the Newes, which
Oxford Newes was called _Mercurius Aulicus_, which he writt wittily
enough, till the surrender of the towne (which was June 24, 1646). He
left a collection of all his _Mercurius Aulicus's_ and all his other
pamphletts, which his executors (Sir Richard Mason and Sir Muddiford
Bramston) were ordered by the king to give to the Archbishop of
Canterbury's library.

After the surrender of Oxford, he was putt out of his fellowship by
the Visitors, and was faine to shift for himselfe as well as he could.
Most part of his time he spent at London, where he mett with severall
persons of quality that loved his company, and made much of him.

He went over into France, where he stayed some time, I thinke not long.
He received grace there from the dutches of Newcastle, I remember he
tolde me.

He gott many a fourty shillings (I beleeve) by pamphletts, such as that
of 'Col. Pride,' and 'The Last Will and Testament of Philip earle of
Pembroke,' &c.

At the restauration of his majestie he was made Master of the
Facultees, and afterwards one of the Masters of Requests. He was
exceedingly confident[415], witty, not very gratefull to his
benefactors, would lye damnably. He was of midling stature, great
goggli eies, not of a sweet aspect.

He was chosen a burghes of Parliament at Wilton in Wiltshire, anno
Domini 166<1>, i.e. of the King's long parliament. Anno 167<9> upon the
choosing of _this_ Parliament[416], he went downe to be elected, and at
Salisbury heard[417] how he was scorned and mocked at Wilton (whither
he was goeing) and called _Pensioner_, etc.--

    [Vendidit hic auro patriam, dominumque potentem
    Imposuit; leges fixit pretio atque refixit.

                             VIRG. _Aeneid_, lib. vi. 621.

--This was Curio: vide Servium de hoc]--he went not to the borough
where he intended to stand; but returned to London, and tooke it so
to heart that he insensibly decayed and pined away; and so, December
...[XXI.], 1679, dyed at his lodgeings in Whitehall, and was buried
Saturday, December 6, in St. Martyn's churchyard[XXII.] in-the-Fields,
neer the church, according to his will and testament. His executors
intend to sett up an inscription for him against the church wall.

[XXI.] quaere Anthony Wood to whom I writt the day of his death, which
as I remember was the same day that Mr. Hobbes died.

[XXII.] His reason[418] was because he sayd they removed the bodies out
of the church.

He had the art of locall memory; and his topiques were the chambers,
&c., in All Soules colledge (about 100), so that for 100 errands, &c.,
he would easily remember.

[419]He was created Dr. of LL.; had been with the king[420]. His
library was sold to Sir Robert Atkins for 200 _li._ His MSS. (chiefly
copies of records) for 900 _li._




=Henry Birkhead= (1617-1696).


[421]My old acquaintance, Dr. Henry Birkhed, formerly fellow of your
college[422] (but first was commoner of Trinity College Oxon) was an
universally <belove>d man.

He had his schoole education under Mr. Farnary[423] and <was his>
beloved disciple.

He died at the Bird-cage (at his sister's, Mris Knight, the famous
singer) in St. James's parke, <on> Michaelmas-eve 1696, aged about 80.

He was borne in London <at the> Paul-head tavern (which his father
kept) in Paule's chaine <in> St. Paul's church-yard anno 1617, baptized
the 25 of September. John Gadbury haz his nativity from him.

I will aske his sister (Mris Knight) for a very ingeniose diatribe that
he wrote on Martialis epigram. lib. <xi. 94. 8>,

                      jura, verpe, per Anchialum,

which he haz cleared beyond his master Farnaby, Scaliger, or any other.
'Scaliger,' he sayd, 'speakes the truth, but not the whole truth.' 'Tis
pity it should be lost, and I would reposit it in the Museum.

I gave my Holyoke's dictionary to the Museum. Pray looke on the blank
leaves at the end of it, and you will find a thundering copie of verses
that he gave me, in the praise of this king[424] of France. Now he is
dead, it may be look't-upon.




=Richard Blackbourne= (1652-17..?).

[425]Richard Blackburne, Londinensis, was of Trinity College,
Cambridge, M.A. Tooke his M.D. degree at Leyden about 5 or 6 yeares
since. He practises but little; studies much. A generall scholar,
prodigious memorie, sound judgment; but 30 yeares old now.




=John Blagrave= (1550-1611).

    In MS. Aubr. 8 (Aubrey's _Lives of English Mathematicians_),
    fol. 76, 'Mr. John Blagrave of Reding' is noted as a life to be
    written, and the coat is given in trick 'or, on a bend sable, 3
    greaves argent.' In the Index (fol. 8) at the beginning of the
    same volume he is noted:--

    'John Blagrave of Reding, vide his will, quaere Mr. Morden.'




=Robert Blake= (1599-1657).


[426]... Blake, admirall, was borne at ... in com. Somerset; was[427]
of Albon-hall, in Oxford. He was there a young man of strong body, and
good parts. He was an early riser and studyed well, but also tooke his
robust pleasures of fishing, fowling, &c. He would steale swannes--from
H. Norborne, B.D., his contemporary there[428].

He served in the House of Commons for....[429] Anno Domini <1649> he
was made admirall. He did the greatest actions at sea that ever were
done, viz.,....

... Blake obiit anno Domini <1657> and was buried in King Henry 7th's
chapell; but upon the returne of the king, his body was taken up again
and removed by Mr. Wells' occasion, and where it is now, I know not.
Quaere Mr. Wells of Bridgewater.

Vide Diurnalls, and Rushworth's History; vide Anthony Wood's _Hist. <et
Antiq. Oxon.>_.




=Sir Henry Blount= (1602-1682).


[430]Sir Henry Blount, Tittinghanger, natus Dec. 15, 1602, 9ʰ P.M.

[431]Sir Henry Blount obiit 9th Oct. last[432] in the morning.

[433]Sir Henry Blount[AS], knight:--he was borne (I presume) at
Tittinghanger in the countie of Hertford. It was heretofore the summer
seate of the Lord Abbot of St. Alban's.

He was of Trinity College in Oxford[434], where was a great
acquaintance[435] between him and Mr. Francis Potter. He stayed there
about <four> yeares. From thence he went to Grayes Inne, where he stayd
... and then sold his chamber there to Mr. Thomas Bonham[AT] (the poet)
and travelled--voyage into the Levant. May 7, 1634, he embarqued at
Venice for Constantinople: vide his _Voyage into the Levant_, printed
London 16--, in 4to. He returned....

He was pretty wild when young, especially addicted to common wenches.
He was a 2d brother.

He was a gentleman pensioner to King Charles I, on whom he wayted (as
it was his turne) to Yorke (when the King deserted the Parliament);
was with him at Edge-hill fight; came with him to Oxford; and so
returned to London; walkt[436] into Westminster hall with his sword by
his side; the Parliamentarians all stared upon him as a _Cavaleer_,
knowing that he had been with the King: was called before the House of
Commons, where he remonstrated to them he did but his duty, and so they
acquitted him.

In these dayes he dined most commonly at the Heycock's[437] ordinary,
neer the Pallzgrave-head taverne, in the Strand, which was much
frequented by Parliament-men and gallants. One time colonel Betridge
being there (one[438] of the handsomest men about the towne) and
bragged much how the woemen loved him; Sir H. Blount did lay a wager
of ... with him that let them two goe together to a bordello; he only
(without money) with his handsome person, and Sir Henry with a XX_s._
piece on his bald crowne, that the wenches should choose Sir Henry
before Betridge; and Sir H. won the wager. E<dmund> W<yld>, esq., was
one of the witnesses.

Memorandum:--there was about 164.. a pamphlet (writt by Henry Nevill,
esq., ἀνονυμῶς) called _The Parliament of Ladies_, 3 or 4 sheets in
4to, wherin Sir Henry Blount was first to be called to the barre for
spreading abroad that abominable and dangerous doctrine that it was far
cheaper and safer to lye with common wenches[439] then with ladies of
quality[440].

☞ His estate left him by his father was 500 _li._ per annum, which he
sold to ... (quaere) for an annuitie of 1000 _li._ per annum in anno
Domini 16..; and since his elder brother dyed.

Anno Domini 165<1/2> he was made one of the comittee for regulating
the lawes. He was severe against tythes, and for the abolishing them,
and that every minister should have 100 _li._ per annum and no more.

Since he was ... year old he dranke nothing but water or coffee.
1647 or therabout, he maryed to Mris [Hester[d]] Wase, [daughter of
Christopher Wase[441]], who dyed 1679; by whom he haz two sonnes,
ingeniose young gentlemen. Charles Blount (his second son) hath writt
_Anima Mundi_, 8vo, 167<9> (burnt by order of the bishop of London) and
of _Sacrifices_, 8vo.

I remember twenty yeares since he inveighed much against sending
youths to the universities--quaere if his sons there--because they
learnt there to be debaucht; and that the learning that they learned
there[442] they were to unlearne againe, as a man that is buttond
or laced too hard, must unbutton before he can be at his ease.
Drunkennesse he much exclaimed against, but he allowed wenching. When
coffee first came-in he was a great upholder of it, and hath ever since
been a constant frequenter of coffee houses, especially Mr. ... Farre
at the Rainbowe by Inner Temple Gate, and lately John's coffee house in
Fuller's rents.

☞ The first coffee house in London[XXIII.] was in St. Michael's Alley
in Cornehill, opposite to the Church; which was sett up by one ...
Bowman (coachman to Mr. Hodges, a Turkey merchant, who putt him upon
it) in or about the yeare 1652. 'Twas about 4 yeares before any other
was sett up, and that was by Mr. Far. Jonathan Paynter, opposite to
St. Michael's Church, was the first apprentice to the trade, viz. to
Bowman. Memorandum:--the Bagneo, in Newgate Street, was built and first
opened in Decemb. 1679: built by ... (Turkish merchants).

[XXIII.] And the next was Mr. Farr's a barber, which was set up in
anno....

He is a gentleman of a very clear judgement, great experience, much
contemplation, not of very much reading, of great foresight into
government. His conversation is admirable. When he was young, he was a
great collector of bookes, as his sonne is now.

He was heretofore a great _shammer_, i.e. one that tells falsities not
to doe any body any injury, but to impose on their understanding:--e.g.
at Mr. Farre's; that at an inne (nameing the signe) in St. Alban's,
the inkeeper had made a hogs-trough of a free-stone coffin; but the
pigges, after that, grew leane, dancing and skipping, and would run up
on the topps of the houses like goates. Two young gentlemen that heard
Sir H. tell this _sham_ so gravely, rode the next day to St. Alban's
to enquire: comeing there, nobody had heard of any such thing, 'twas
altogether false. The next night as soon as the<y> allighted, they
came to the Rainbowe and found Sir H., looked louringly on him, and
told him they wonderd he was not ashamed to tell such storys as, &c.,
'Why, gentlemen,' (sayd Sir H.) 'have you been there to make enquiry?'
'Yea,' sayd they. 'Why truly, gentlemen,' sayd Sir H. 'I heard you tell
strange things that I knew to be false. I would not have gonne over the
threshold of the dore to have found you in a lye:' at which all the
company laught at the two young gentlemen.

He was wont to say that he did not care to have his servants goe to
church, for there servants infected one another to goe to the alehouse
and learne debauchery; but he did bid them goe to see the executions at
Tyburne, which worke more upon them then all the oratory in the sermons.

His motto over his printed picture is that which I have many yeares ago
heard him speake of, viz.:--_Loquendum est cum vulgo, sentiendum cum
sapientibus_.

He is now (1680) neer or altogether 80 yeares, his intellectualls good
still, and body pretty strong.

This last weeke[443] of Sept. 1682, he was taken very ill at London,
and his feet swelled; and removed to Tittinghanger.


_Notes._

[AS] Aubrey gives in colours the coats:--'or, 2 bars nebulé sable
[Blount]'; and 'or, 2 bars nebulé sable [Blount]; impaling, barry of
six or and gules [Wase].' Also the references (a) 'vide Anthony Wood's
_<Hist. et> Antiq. Oxon._'; (b) 'vide Heralds' Office.' Aubrey, in MS.
Wood F. 39, writing on April 7, 1673, says of Blount, 'His father was
Sir Thomas Pope Blount, and his grandmother (as I remember I have heard
Dr. Hannibal Potter say) was our founder's daughter.'

[AT] Aubrey, in MS. Wood F. 39, fol. 199, speaks of him as 'Tom Bonham,
of Essex, that haz made many a good song and epitaph--

                   When the shrill scirocco blowes.'






=Edmund Bonner= (1495-1569).


[444]Mr. Steevens[445], ... whom I mett lately accidentally, informed
me thus:--that bishop Bonner was of Broadgates hall; that he came
thither a poor boy, and was at first a skullion boy in the kitchin,
afterwards became a servitor, and so by his industry raysed to what he
was.

When he came to his greatnes, in acknowledgement from whence he had
his rise, he gave[446] to the kitchin there a great brasse-pott, called
Bonner's pott, which was taken away in the parliament time. He has
shewed the pott to me, I remember. It was the biggest, perhaps, in
Oxford: quaere the old cooke how much it contayned.

=James Bovey= (1622-16..).


[448]James Bovey[AU] borne at London May 7th, 1622, 6 a clock in the
morning[449].

James Bovey, esq., was the youngest son of Andrew Bovey, merchant,
cash-keeper to Sir Peter Vanore, in London.

He was borne in the middle of Mincing Lane, in the parish of Saint
Dunstan's in the East, London, anno 1622, May 7th, at six a clock in
the morning. Went to schoole at Mercers Chapell, under Mr. Augur. At
9 sent into the Lowe Countreys; then returned, and perfected himselfe
in the Latin and Greeke. <At> 14, travelled into France and Italie,
Switzerland, Germany, and the Lowe Countreys. Returned into England at
19; then lived with one Hoste, a banquier, 8 yeares, was his cashier 8
or 9 yeares. Then traded for himselfe (27) till he was 31; then maried
the only daughter of William de Vischer, a merchant; lived 18 yeares
with her, then continued single. Left off trade at 32, and retired to
a countrey life, by reason of his indisposition, the ayre of the citie
not agreing with him. Then in these retirements he wrote _Active[450]
Philosophy_, (a thing not donne before) wherin are enumerated all the
Arts and Tricks practised in Negotiation, and how they were to be
ballanced by counter-prudentiall rules.

Whilest he lived with Mr. Hoste, he kept the cash of the ambassadors
of Spaine that were here; and of the farmers, called by them
_Assentistes_, that did furnish the Spanish and Imperiall armies of the
Low-Countreys and Germany; and also many other great cashes, as of Sir
Theodore Mayern, etc.; his dealing being altogether in money-matters:
by which meanes he became acquainted with the ministers of state both
here and abroad.

When he was abroad, his chiefe employment was to observe the affaires
of state and their judicatures, and to take the politique surveys in
the countreys he travelled thorough, more especially in relation to
trade. He speakes[451] the Low-Dutch, High-Dutch, French, Italian,
Spanish and Lingua Franco, and Latin, besides his owne.

When he retired from businesse he studied the Lawe-Merchant, and
admitted himselfe of the Inner Temple, London, about 1660. His judgment
haz been taken in most of the great causes of his time in points
concerning the Lawe-Merchant. As to his person he is about 5 foot high,
slender[452], strait, haire exceeding black and curling at the end, a
dark hazell[453] eie, of a midling size, but the most sprightly that I
have beheld. Browes and beard of the colour as his haire. A person of
great temperance, and deepe thoughts, and a working head, never idle.
From[454] 14 he had a candle burning by him all night, with pen, inke,
and paper, to write downe thoughts as they came into his head; that
so he might not loose a thought. Was ever a great lover of Naturall
Philosophie. His whole life has been perplex't in lawe-suites, (which
haz made him expert in humane affaires), in which he alwaies over-came.
He had many lawe-suites with powerfull adversaries; one lasted 18
yeares. Red-haired men never had any kindnesse for him. He used to
say:--

                In rufa pelle non est animus sine felle.

In all his travells he was never robbed.

He has one son, and one daughter who resembles him.

From 14 he began to take notice of all prudentiall rules as came in his
way, and wrote them downe, and so continued till this day, Sept. 28,
1680, being now in his 59th yeare.

For his health he never had it very well, but indifferently, alwaies a
weake stomach, which proceeded from the agitation of the braine. His
dyet was alwayes fine diet: much chicken[455].

He wrote a Table of all the Exchanges in Europe.

[456]He hath writt (which is in his custodie, and which I have seen,
and many of them read) these treatises, viz.

1. The Characters, or Index Rerum <etc.[457]>

Society.

He made it his businesse[461] to advance the trade of England, and many
men have printed his conceptions.

gules, five besants, between 2 eagles proper;' and an impression of
Bovey's seal with the same coat.




=Richard Boyle=, earl of Cork (1566-1643).


[462]Earl of Corke:--vide countesse of Warwick's funerall sermon, 2 or
3 shops[463] within Paul's churchyard.

[464]Earl of Corke[AV]--Thomas, earl of Strafford made him disgorge
1500 _li._ per annum, which he restored to the church--<from> Mr. ...
Anderson.

Earl of Corke bought of captaine Horsey _fourtie plough__lands_ in
Ireland for fourtie pounds. (A. Ettrick assures me, 'I say againe
fourtie ploughlands.')

The queen gave Lismore to Sir Walter Raleigh, and ... to Sir John
Anderson, etc. to etc., eâ intentione to plant them, which they did
not; and were not planted till since the last rebellion--quaere Mr.
Anderson, who sayes that Ireland could not be secure till it was enough
peopled with English.

My lady Petty sayes he had a wife or two before, and that he maried
Mris. Fenton[AW] without her father's consent--(quaere Secretary
Fenton's Christian name[AX]).

[465]... Boyle, the first earle of Corke:--the countesse of Thanet, his
great-grand-daughter, daughter to this earle of Corke and Burlington,
haz told me that her father has a booke in folio--thick--of her
grandfather's writing, <giving> the place, day, and hour of birth,
and by what steps, wayes, and degrees he came to his greatnes. Which
she will doe her endeavour to gett me an extract of it, but it is in
Ireland and (I thinke) must be kept there, and is an heir-loome to the
family.


<_Excerpts from Anthony Walker's Sermon._>

[466]Of Richard Boyle, first earl of Corke, and his seventh daughter,
Mary, countess of Warwick.

'THE VIRTUOUS WOMAN FOUND: Being a Sermon preached at Felsted, in
Essex, at the Funerall of the most excellent and religious lady, the
Right honourable MARY Countesse Dowager of Warwick. By Anthony Walker,
D.D. rector of Fyfield, in the sayd countie. The 2d Edition corrected.
Printed at London, for Nath. Ranew, at the King's Arms, in St. Paul's
Church-yard, 1680.' (The Epistle dedicatory is dated May 27, 1678.)

    Pag. 44.--'She was truly excellent and great in all respects:
    great in the honour of her birth, being born a lady and a
    virtuosa both; seventh daughter of that eminently honourable,
    Richard, the first earle of Cork; who being born a private
    gentleman, and younger brother of a younger brother, to no
    other heritage than is expressed in the device and motto, which
    his humble gratitude inscribed on all the palaces he built,

                 _God's Providence, mine Inheritance_;

    by that Providence, and his diligent and wise industry, raised
    such an honour and estate, and left such a familie, as never
    any subject of these three kingdomes did, and that with so
    unspotted a reputation of integrity that the most invidious
    scrutiny could find no blott, though it winnowed all the
    methods of his rising most severely, which our good lady hath
    often told me with great content and satisfaction.

    This noble lord, by his prudent and pious consort, no lesse
    an ornament and honour to their descendants than himself,
    was blessed with five sonnes, (of which he lived to see four
    lords and peeres of the kingdome of Ireland,[467] and a fifth,
    more than these titles speak, a soveraigne and peerlesse in
    a larger province,--that of universall nature, subdued and
    made obsequious to his inquisitive mind), and eight daughters.
    And that you may remark how all things were extraordinary in
    this great personage, it will, I hope, be neither unpleasant,
    nor impertinent, to add a short story I had from our lady's
    own mouth:--Master Boyl, after earle of Cork (who was then a
    widdower), came one morning to waite on Sir Jeofry Fenton, at
    that time a great officer[XXIV.] of state in that kingdome of
    Ireland, who being ingaged in business, and not knowing who it
    was who desired to speake with him, a while delayed him access;
    which time he spent pleasantly with his young daughter in her
    nurse's arms. But when Sir Jeoffry came, and saw whom he had
    made stay somewhat too long, he civilly excused it. But master
    Boyl replied, he had been very well entertayned; and spent his
    time much to his satisfaction, in courting his daughter, if he
    might obtaine the honour to be accepted for his son-in-lawe. At
    which Sir Jeoffry, smiling (to hear one who had been formerly
    married, move for a wife carried in arms, and under two years
    old,) asked him if he would stay for her? To which he frankly
    answered him he would, and Sir Jeoffry as generously promised
    him he should then have his consent. And they both kept their
    words honourably. And by this virtuous lady he had thirteen
    children, ten of which he lived to see honourably married, and
    died a grandfather by the youngest of them.

    [XXIV.] Secretary of Estate.

    Nor did she derive less honour from the collateral, than the
    descending line, being sister by soul and genius, as well as
    bloud, to these great personages, whose illustrious, unspotted,
    and resplendent honour and virtue, and whose usefull learning
    and accurate pens, may attone and[468]expiate, as well as
    shame, the scandalous blemishes of a debauched, and the many
    impertinencies of a scribling, age:--

    (1), Richard, the truly right honourable, loyal, wise, and
    virtuous, earl of Burlington and Cork, whose life is his
    fairest and most laudable character;

    (2), the right honourable Roger earle of Orery, that great
    poet, great statesman, great soldier, and great every-thing
    which merits the name of great or good;

    (3), Francis lord Shannon, whose _Pocket Pistol_, as he stiles
    his book, may make as wide breaches in the walls of the
    Capitol, as many canons;

    (4), and that honourable and well known name Robert Boyl,
    esquier, that profound philosopher, accomplished humanist,
    and excellent divine, I had almost sayd lay-bishop, as one
    hath stiled Sir Henry Savil; whose works alone may make a
    librarie[XXV.].

    [XXV.] Why does he not mention ... lord Killimeke[AY]; who was slain at
the great battell of Liskarrill, in Ireland?

    The female branches also (if it be lawfull so to call them
    whose virtues were so masculine, souls knowing no difference of
    sex) by their honours and graces (by mutuall reflections) gave,
    and received lustre, to, and from, her:--

    the eldest of which, the lady Alice, was married to the lord
    Baramore;

    the second, the lady Sarah, to the lord Digby, of Ireland;

    the third, the lady Laetitia, to the eldest son of the lord
    Goring, who died earle of Norwich;

    the fourth, the lady Joan, to the earle of Kildare, not only
    primier earle of Ireland, but the _ancientest house_ in
    Christendome of that degree, the present earle being the six
    and twentieth, or the seaven and twentieth, of lineal descent:
    and, as I have heard, it was that great antiquary King Charles
    the First his observation, that the three ancientest families
    of Europe for nobility, were the _Veres_ in England, earls of
    Oxford, and the _Fitz-Geralds_ in Ireland, earls of Kildare,
    and _Momorancy_ in France: 'tis observable[469]that the present
    earle of Kildare is a mixture of blood of Fitz-Geralds and
    Veres;

    the fifth, the lady Katharine, who was married to the lord
    viscount Ranelaugh[XXVI.], and mother to the present generous
    earle of Ranelaugh, of which family I could have added an
    eminent remark, I meet with in Fuller's "Worthies;" this lady's
    character is so signalized by her known merit among all persons
    of honour, that as I need not, so I dare not, attempt beyond
    this one word--she was our lady's _Friend-Sister_;

    [XXVI.] <Arthur> Jones.

    the sixth, the lady Dorothy Loftus;

    the seaventh, (the number of perfection) which shutt-up and
    crown'd this noble train (for the eighth, the lady Margaret,
    died unmaried), was our excellent lady Mary, married to
    Charles, earle of Warwick; of whom, if I should use the
    language of my text, I should neither despair their pardon,
    nor fear the reproach of rudeness--_Many daughters_, all his
    daughters, _did virtuously but thou_--PROV. xxxi. 29, 30, 31.

    ----But shee[XXVII.] needed neither borrowed shades, nor
    reflexive lights, to set her off, being personally great in
    all naturall endowments and accomplishments of soul and body,
    wisdome, beautie, favour, and virtue;

    [XXVII.] Mary, countess of Warwick.

    great by her tongue, for never woman used one better, speaking
    so gracefully, promptly, discreetly, pertinently, holily, that
    I have often admired the edifying words that proceeded from her
    mouth;

    great by her pen, as you may (_ex pede Herculem_) discover
    by that little[XXVIII.] tast of it the world hath been happy
    in, the hasty fruit of one or two interrupted houres after
    supper, which she professed to me, with a little regret, when
    she was surprised with it's sliding into the world without her
    knowledge, or allowance, and wholly beside her expectation;

    [XXVIII.] Her ladyship's _Pious Meditations_.

    great by being the greatest mistresse and promotress, not to
    say the foundress and inventress, of a new science--the art of
    obliging; in which she attain'd that sovereign perfection, that
    she reigned over all their hearts with whom she did converse;

    great in her nobleness of living and hospitality;

    great in the unparallelld sincerity of constant, faithfull,
    condescending friendship, and for that law of kindness which
    dwelt in her lips and heart;

    great in her dexterity of management;

    great in her quick apprehension of the difficulties of her
    affaires, and where the stress and pinch lay, to untie the
    knot, and loose and ease them;

    great in the conquest of herselfe;

    great in a thousand things beside, which the world admires as
    such: but she despised them all, and counted them but loss and
    dung in comparison of the feare of God, and the excellency of
    the knowledge of Christ Jesus.'


_Notes._

[AV] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'per bend crenellée argent and
gules [Boyle]; impaling, ..., a cross vert between 4 fleur de lys ...
[Fenton],' surmounted by an earl's coronet.

A leaf containing an earlier draft of this life (as shown by the coat
tricked in the inner margin) has been cut out between fol. 14 and fol.
15 of MS. Aubr. 6. The excision was made by Aubrey himself, a line
being drawn by him across the excision from fol. 14ᵛ to fol. 15, to
mark the transposition of a passage. The reason for the cutting out
of this leaf is suggested in a letter of Aubrey to Anthony Wood (MS.
Wood F. 39, fol. 360, July 14, 1681), where he says his 'Lives' contain
'severe touches on the earl of Corke, Dr. Wallis, etc.' In the margin
of the excised leaf a note, given on the authority of 'Mr. A. E.' i.e.
Anthony Ettrick, seems to speak of amours and bastards of the earl.

[AW] Catherine Fenton, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton, Secretary of
State for Ireland 1581-1603.

[AX] Anthony Wood, in answer to this query, suggests:--'Jeffrey,
quaere.'

[AY] Lewis Boyle, second son of Richard, first earl of Cork, created
viscount Boyle of Kynalmeaky, 1627/8.




=Robert Boyle= (1626/7-1691).


[470]Mr. Robert Boyle;--vide Oliver Hill's ..., where he is accused of
grosse plagiarisme. Dr. <Robert> Wood went to schoole with him at Eaton
Colledge.

[471]Mr. R. Boyle, when a boy at Eaton <was> verie sickly and
pale--from Dr. <Robert> Wood, who was his schoole-fellow.

[472]The honourable Robert Boyle[AZ] esq., the <fifth> son of Richard
Boyle, the first earle of Corke, was borne at Lismor[XXIX.] in the
county of Corke, the <25> day of <January> anno <1626/7>.

[XXIX.] It was anciently an University, and a great towne or city. It
had twenty churches. 'Twas the seate of king John.--From Elizabeth,
countesse of Thanet.

He was nursed by an Irish nurse, after the Irish manner, wher they putt
the child into a pendulous satchell (insted of a cradle), with a slitt
for the child's head to peepe out.

He learn't his Latin.... Went to the university of Leyden. Travelled
France, Italy, Switzerland. I have oftentimes heard him say that after
he had seen the antiquities and architecture of Rome, he esteemed
none[473] any where els.

He speakes Latin very well, and very readily, as most men I have
mett with. I have heard him say that when he was young, he read over
Cowper's dictionary: wherin I thinke he did very well, and I beleeve he
is much beholding to him for his mastership of that language.

His father in his will, when he comes to the settlement and provision
for his son Robert, thus,--

_Item, to my son Robert, whom I beseech God to blesse with a particular
blessing, I bequeath, &c._

Mr. R. H.[474], who has seen the rentall, sayes it was 3000 _li._ per
annum: the greatst part is in Ireland. His father left him the mannor
of Stalbridge in com. Dorset, where is a great freestone house; it was
forfeited by the earle of Castlehaven.

He is very tall (about six foot high) and streight, very temperate, and
vertuouse, and frugall: a batcheler; keepes a coach; sojournes with his
sister, the lady Ranulagh. His greatest delight is chymistrey. He haz
at his sister's a noble laboratory, and severall servants (prentices
to him) to looke to it. He is charitable to ingeniose men that are
in want, and foreigne chymists have had large proofe of his bountie,
for he will not spare for cost to gett any rare secret. At his owne
costs and chardges he gott translated and printed the New Testament in
Arabique[BA], to send into the Mahometan countreys. He has not only
a high renowne in England, but abroad; and when foreigners come to
hither, 'tis one of their curiosities to make him a visit.


_Notes._

[AZ] Aubrey gives in colours the Boyle coat (_supra_, p. 119), with a
mullet gules for difference. Anthony Wood adds the reference:--'see
in the first sheet of the second part,' i.e. of MS. Aubr. 7, viz. the
excerpts _supra_ from Anthony Walker's sermon.

[BA] The Gospels and Acts in Malay (in Arabic character), Oxford, 1677.




=William Brereton=, 3rd baron, (1631-1680).


[475]William, lord Brereton, obiit March 17, 1680[476]; buried at St.
Martin's-in-the-fields: scripsit _Origines Moriens_ in Latin verse.

[477]William, lord Brereton[BB] of <Leighlin>:--this vertuous and
learned lord (who was my most honoured and obligeing friend) was
educated at Breda, by John Pell, D.D., then Math. Professor there of
the Prince of Orange's 'ilustrious schoole.' Sir George Goring, earl of
Norwich (who was my lord's grandfather), did send for him over, where
the <Doctor> (then Mr. John Pell) tooke great care of him, and made him
a very good Algebrist.

He hath wrote a poem called _Origines Moriens_, a MS.

Obiit March 17, 1679/80, London, and is buried at St Martin's church in
the fields.

He was an excellent musitian, and also a good composer.


_Note._

[BB] Anthony Wood adds the reference 'quaere in Coll. Exon.' Wood seems
to have thought that Sir William Brereton of Honford in Cheshire (an
officer in the Parliamentary army, mentioned in the _Athenae_) might be
found among the Exeter College matriculations and might be connected
with this peer's family.




=Edward Brerewood= (1565-1613).


[478]Mr. Edward Brerewood[BC] was borne....

He was of Brasen-nose College in Oxon. My old cosen Whitney[BD], fellow
there long since, told me, as I remember, that his father was a citizen
of W<est> Chester; that (I have now forgot on what occasion, whether
he had outrun the exhibition from his father, or what), but he was for
some time in straightes in the College; that he went not out of the
College gates in a good while, nor (I thinke) out of his chamber, but
was in slip-shoes, and wore out his gowne and cloathes on the bord and
benches of his chamber, but profited in knowledge wonderfully.

He writ his _Logica_, and ..., _de meteoris_, _de ponderibus et nummis_
(which he dedicates to his countryman, Lord Chancellor Egerton, who was
no doubt his patron).

He was astronomie professor at Gresham College, London, where he died
anno 1613, and was buried in Great Saint Helen's chancell: so _Hist.
and Antiq. of Oxon._, lib. 2. pag. 219 b.

'Tis pity I can pick-up no more of him.


_Notes._

[BC] Anthony Wood added the reference 'vide A. W.'s _<Hist. et>
Antiq._'; but scored it out, finding himself anticipated in the text of
the notice.

[BD] James Whitney, matric. April 19, 1611 at St. Mary Hall, but took

=Henry Briggs= (1556-1630/1).


[479]Henry Briggs was borne at ... (vide Anthony Wood's _Oxon.
Antiquit._: quaere his nephew who is beadle to Stationers' Hall; quaere
_Vaticinium Carolinum_, an English poem).

He was first of St. John's College in Cambridge. Sir Henry Savill
sent for him and made him his geometrie professor. He lived at Merton
College in Oxon, where he made the dialls at the buttresses of the east
end of the chapell with a bullet for the axis.

He travelled into Scotland to comune with the honourable ... lord
Nepier[BE] of Marcheston about making the logarithmicall tables.

☞ Looking one time on the mappe of England he observed that the[480]
two rivers, the Thames and that Avon which runnes to Bathe and so to
Bristowe, were not far distant, scilicet, about 3 miles--vide the
mappe. He sees 'twas but about 25 miles from Oxford; getts a horse
and viewes it and found it to be a levell ground and[481] easie to be
digged. Then he considered the chardge of cutting between them and the
convenience of making a mariage between those rivers which would be of
great consequence for cheape and safe carrying of goods between London
and Bristow, and though the boates[482] goe slowly and with meanders,
yet considering they goe day and night they would be at their journey's
end almost as soon as the waggons, which often are overthrowne and
liquours spilt and other goods broken. Not long after this he dyed and
the civill warres brake-out. It happened by good luck that one Mr.
Matthewes of Dorset had some acquaintance with this Mr.[483] Briggs
and had heard him discourse of it. He was an honest simple man, and
had runne out of his estate and this project did much run in his head.
He would revive it (or els it had been lost and forgott) and went into
the country to make an ill survey of it (which he printed) about anno
..., but with no great encouragement of the countrey or others. Upon
the restauration of King Charles II he renewed his designe and applyed
himselfe to the king and counsell. His majestie espoused it more (he
told me) then any one els. In short, for want of management and his
non-ability, it came to nothing, and he is now dead of old age. But Sir
Jonas Moore ( ☞ an expert mathematician and a practicall man), being
sent to survey the mannor of Dantesey in Wilts (which was forfeited to
the crowne by Sir John Danvers his foolery), went to see these streames
and distances. He told me the streames were too small unlesse in
winter; but if some prince or the Parliament would rayse money to cutt
through the hill by Wotton-Basset which is not very high, then there
would be water enough and streames big enough. He computed the chardge,
which I have forgott, but I thinke it was about 200,000 _li._

Insert his letter to Dr. John Pell _de logarithmis_ written anno Dni
1628.

An epitaph on H. Briggs among H. Burched's poems[BF].

[484]Mr. Briggs--vide and quaere Dr. Whitchcot, behind St. Lawrence
Church; he knew him.----Respondet quod non.

[485]Mr. Norwood to the reader, before his Trigonometrie:--'of the
construction and divers applications of Logarithmes Mr. Brigs hath
written a booke called _Arithmetica Logarithmica_, and since again
began another excellent worke of like nature entituled _Trigonometria
Britannica_. I have onely seen (in the hands of a friend of his) a
printed copie of so much as he had done, namely the tables: but whilest
he was in hand with the rest, he departed this life. It was writ in
Latin.'

Alexander was created baron Napier in 1627.

printed book, a miscellany of Greek and Latin verses. The first piece
on p. 49 is six Greek lines 'Epitaphium D. Henrici Briggi ob mathesin

MDCXXXVI.'




=Thomas Brightman= (1562-1607).


<_A Letter from Edward Gibson about Thomas Brightman[BG]._>

                                             [486]Hawnes, Dec. 21, <16>81.

  Sir,

Since you have desired and have been put into an expectation of
receiving some information concerning Mr. Brightman, tho I have litle
or nothing to serve you and your freind with, I send this to let you
know that I find nothing of his arms; that upon the stone is engraven

    'Here lyeth the body of Thomas Brightman, deceased, minister of
    this parish, who dyed Aug. 24, 1607.'

Over his head are these sad rimes (I hope they are Oxford, tho not much
for the honour of it).--

    Christ cals his churches candlestiks of old,
    Altho the candlesticks but the candles hold.
    The lights on them hee calleth angels pure,
    Not barely candles, for those must endure.
    Candles when burn't out are soon forgott,
    But ministers, as angels, must not rot.
    Sith God doth ministers so eternize,
    Let not us mortals give them lower prize.
    And specially to Brightman's recommendacion
    And bee entomed a light to th' revelation
    Wee must, wee ought, to make such saints last
    In whom wee know the times to come and past.

  I am, Sir, Yours to serve you,
                                         Edw. Gibson.

Dr. Fuller, amongst his _Worthies_, hath something of Mr. Brightman.

[487]For Mr. John Aubrey: leave this at Mr. Hooke's lodging in Gresham
College.


_Note._

[BG] In MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 3, Anthony Wood has jotted down 'quaere Mr.
Aubrey of Thomas Brightman, Dr. <William> Butler, Henry Billingsley,
Sir George Wharton'--Aubrey's notes, so far, about these four having
been scanty.

In MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 48ᵛ, opposite Gibson's letter Wood notes an odd
omission in it:--'Quaere _in what church_ Mr. Thomas Brightman was
buried?'




=Alexander Brome= (1620-1666).


[488]H. Brome assured me that his brother Alexander was in his
accedence at 4 yeares old and a quarter[BH].


_Note._

[BH] This is a marginal note opposite the life of Katherine Philips,
and is intended to be a parallel instance of precocious reading, the
boy being taken, first, through the Psalter, and then through the
Bible, before beginning his 'accidence' (i.e. Latin Grammar): cp. the
course of Anthony Wood's education, Clark's Wood's _Life and Times_, i.
46, 47, 48. Henry Brome was a London bookseller.




=Christopher Brookes= (16..-1665).


[489]Christopher Brookes, of Oxford, a mathematical instrument maker.
He was sometime manciple of Wadham College: his widowe lived over
against the Theatre.

This C. B. printed[490] 1649 an 8vo of about 2 sheetes, scil. 'A new
quadrant of more natural easie and manifold performance than any other
heretofore extant': but it was his father-in-lawe's[491] invention. I
had it from his widow about 1665.




=Elizabeth Broughton.=

[492]In the Heralds' Office--Heref<ordshire>--

  Edward Broughton,  _m._ Isabell, daughter of
  of Kington, eldest  |   Rafe Beeston, of
  son, 1634           |   Warwickshire.
                      |
                  Elizabeth.

<Arms[493]:--> 'argent, 2 bars gules, on a canton of the second a cross
of the field, a martlet or for difference.'

Mris. Elizabeth Broughton was daughter of ... Broughton of ... in
Herefordshire, an ancient family. Her father lived at the mannour-house
at Canon-Peon. Whether she was borne there or no, I know not: but
there she lost her mayden-head to a poor young fellow, then I beleeve
handsome, but, in 1660, a pittifull poor old weaver, clarke of the
parish. He had fine curled haire, but gray. Her father at length
discoverd her inclinations and locked her up in the turret of the
house, but she (like a ...) getts downe by a rope; and away she gott to
London, and did sett-up for her selfe.

She was a most exquisite beautie, as finely shaped as nature could
frame; and had a delicate witt. She was soon taken notice of at London,
and her price was very deare--a second Thais. Richard, earle of Dorset,
kept her (whether before or after Venetia[494], I know not, but I
guesse before). At last she grew common and infamous and gott[495] the
pox, of which she died.

I remember thus much of an old song of those dayes, which I have seen
in a collection--'twas by way of litanie--viz.:--

    From the watch at twelve a clock,
    And from Bess Broughton's buttond[496] smock,
      _Libera nos, Domine_.

In Ben Johnson's execrations against Vulcan, he concludes thus:--

    Pox take thee, Vulcan! May Pandora's pox
    And all the ills that flew out of her box
    Light on thee. And if those plagues will not doe
    Thy wive's pox take thee, and _Bess Broughton's_ too.

--In the first edition in 8vo her name is thus at length.

I see that there have been famous woemen before our times.

    Vixêre fortes ante Agamemnona
    Multi, etc.

                                         HORACE, lib. 4, ode 9.

I doe remember her father (1646), neer 80, the handsomest shaped
man that ever my eies beheld, a very wise man and of an admirable
elocution. He was a committee-man in Herefordshire and Glocestershire.
He was commissary to colonel Massey. He was of the Puritan party
heretofore; had a great guift in praying, etc. His wife (I have heard
my grandmother say, who was her neighbor) had as great parts as he. He
was the first that used the improvement of land by soape-ashes when he
lived at Bristowe, where they then threw it away.




=William Brouncker=, 2nd viscount (1620-1684).


[497]William, lord viscount Brouncker of Lions in Ireland: he lived
in Oxford when 'twas a garrison for the King: but he was of no
university, he told me. He addicted himselfe only to the study of the
mathematicks, and was a very great artist in that learning.

His mother was an extraordinary great gamester, and playd all, gold
play; she kept the box herselfe. Mr. ... Arundall (brother of the lord
Wardour) made a song in characters of the nobility. Among others, I
remember this,

    Here's a health to my lady Brouncker and the best card in her hand,
    And a health to my lord her husband, with ne're a foot of land.

He was president of the Royall Society about 15 yeares[BI].

He was ... of the Navy office[BJ].

He dyed April the 5th, 1684; buried the 14th following in the vault
which he caused to be made (8 foot long, 4 foot broad, and about 4 foot
high) in the middle of the quire of Saint Katharine's, neer the Tower,
of which convent he was governour. He gave a fine organ to this church
a little before his death; and whereas it was a noble and large choire,
he divided <it> in the middle with a good skreen (at his owne chardge),
which haz spoiled <it>.


<_A note written by him[BK]._>

  [498]Sir,

These are to give notice that on Friday next the thirtieth day of
this instant November, 1677, being St. Andrew's day, the council and
officers of the Royal Society are to be elected for the year ensuing.
At which election your presence is expected in Gresham Colledge at nine
of the clock in the forenoon precisely.

  (For John Aubrey, esq.)

                                                      Brouncker, P. R. S.


_Notes._

[BI] He was President, 1663, from the incorporation of the Royal
Society, to 1677.

[BJ] He was a Lord of the Admiralty in 1680, and again in 1682.

[BK] The signature is in long sloping letters, like the children's
puzzles of thirty years' back, which could be read only when the
paper was held edgeways. It has beaten Anthony Wood, who notes at the
side:--'What this name is I know not.'




=William Browne= (1591-1645).


[499]The earle of Carnarvon does not remember Mr. Brown[BL], and I
ask't his lordship lately again if any of his servants doe: he assures
me _no_.


_Note._

[BL] The inquiry was made of Charles Dormer, second earl of Carnarvon.
William Browne, author of _Britannia's Pastorals_, had been tutor in
1624 to Robert Dormer (created earl of Carnarvon in 1628) in Exeter
College.




=Robert Burton= (1576/7-1639/40).


[500]Memorandum. Mr. Robert Hooke of Gresham College told me that he
lay in the chamber in Christ Church that was Mr. Burton's, of whom 'tis
whispered that, _non obstante_ all his astrologie and his booke of
Melancholie, he ended his dayes in that chamber by hanging him selfe.




=Thomas Bushell= (1594-1674).


[501]Mr. Thomas Bushell was an ... shire man, borne ...: quaere Thomas
Mariet, esq. [He[502] was borne at Marston in ... shire, neer him.]

He was one of the gentlemen that wayted on the Lord Chancellour Bacon.
'Twas the fashion in those dayes for gentlemen to have their suites of
clothes garnished with buttons. My Lord Bacon was then in disgrace,
and his man Bushell having more buttons then usuall on his cloake,
etc., they sayd that his lord's breech made buttons and Bushell wore
them--from whence he was called _buttond Bushell_.

He was only an English scholar, but had a good witt and a working and
contemplative head. His lord much loved him.

His genius lay most towards naturall philosophy, and particularly
towards the discovery, drayning, and improvement of the silver mines in
Cardiganshire[503], etc.

He had the strangest bewitching way to drawe-in people (yea, discreet
and wary men) into his projects that ever I heard of. His tongue was
a chaine and drewe in so many to be bound for him and to be ingaged
in his designes that he ruined a number. Mr. Goodyere of ... in
Oxfordshire was undon by him among others; see[504] part iii. pag. 6 b.

He was master of the art of running in debt, and lived so long that his
depts were forgott, so that they were the great-grandchildren of the
creditors.

He wrote a stich't treatise of mines and improving of the adits to
them and bellowes to drive-in wind, which Sir John Danvers, his
acquaintance, had, and nayled it[BM] to his parlor-wall at Chelsey,
with some scheme, and I beleeve is there yet: I sawe it there about 10
yeares since.

During the time of the civill warres, he lived in Lundy island.

Anno 1647 or 8, he came over into England; and when he landed at
Chester, and had but one Spanish threepence (this I had then from ...
of Great Tew, to whom he told it), and, sayd he, 'I[505] could have
been contented to have begged a penny, like a poor man.' At that time
he sayd he owed, I forgett whether it was 50 or sixty thousand pounds:
but he was like Sir Kenelm Digby, if he had not 4_d._, wherever he came
he would find respect and credit.

☞ Memorandum, after his master the lord chancellor dyed, he maried
..., and lived at Enston, Oxon; where having some land lyeing on the
hanging of a hill faceing the south, at the foot wherof runnes a fine
cleare stream which petrifies, and where is a pleasant solitude, he
spake to his servant Jack[XXX.] Sydenham to gett a labourer to cleare
some boscage which grew on the side of the hill, and also to dig[506]
a cavity in the hill to sitt, and read or contemplate. The workman had
not workt an hower before he discovers not only a rock, but a rock
of an unusuall figure with pendants like icecles as at Wokey hole
(Somerset), which was the occasion of making that delicate grotto and
those fine walkes.

[XXX.] <Jack Sydenham> lived before with Sir Charles Snell at Kington
St. Michaell. He was wont to carry me in his armes: a gracefull
servant. He gave me this account.

Here in fine weather he would walke all night. Jack Sydenham sang
rarely: so did his other servant, Mr. Batty. They went very gent. in
cloathes, and he loved them as his children.

He did not encumber him selfe with his wife, but here enjoyed himselfe
thus in this paradise till the war brake out, and then retired to Lundy
isle.

He had donne something (I have forgott what) that made him obnoxious to
the Parliament or Oliver Cromwell, about 1650; would have been hangd
if taken; printed severall letters to the Parliament, etc., dated from
beyond sea, and all that time lay privately in his howse in Lambeth
marsh where the[507] pointed pyramis is. In the garret there, is a
long gallery, which he hung all with[508] black, and had some death's
heads and bones painted. At the end where his couch was, was in an old
Gothique nich (like an old monument) painted a skeleton incumbent[509]
on a matt. At the other end where was his pallet-bed was an emaciated
dead man stretched out. Here he had severall mortifying and divine
motto's (he imitated his lord[510] as much as he could), and out of his
windowes a very pleasant prospect. At night he walkt in the garden and
orchard. Only Mr. Sydenham, and an old trusty woman, was privy to his
being in England.

He dyed about 1676 or 1677--quaere where--he was 80 yeares of age.
[He[511] dyed in Scotland yard neer Whitehall about 1675 or 1677; Mr.
Beach the quaker can tell me exactly.]

His entertainment to Queen Henrietta Marie at Enston was in anno 163<6,
23 August>. Insert, i.e. sowe[512] my book (which J. S.[513] gave my
grandfather Isaac Lyte) in this place ... Goodall[BN], of Ch. Ch. Oxon,
composed[514] the musique; I remember the student of Ch. Ch. which sang
the songs (<I> now forgett his name).

[515]Mr. Bushell had a daughter maried to a merchant ... in Bristowe.

He was a handsome proper gentleman when I sawe him at his house
aforesayd at Lambith. He was about 70 but I should have not guessed him
hardly 60. He had a perfect healthy constitution; fresh, ruddy face;
hawke-nosed, and was temperate.

As he had the art of running in dept, so sometimes he was attacqued and
throwen into prison; but he would extricate him selfe again straingely.

He[516] died about 3 yeares since (<from> Sir William Dugdale), i.e.
about 1677; and was buried at....

Memorandum:--in the time of the civill warres his[517] hermitage over
the rocks at Enston were hung with black-bayes; his bed had black
curtaines, etc., but it had no bed-postes but hung by 4 cordes (covered
with black-bayes) instead of bed postes. When the queen-mother came to
Oxon to the king, she either brought (as I thinke) or somebody gave her
an entire mummie from Egypt, a great raritie, which her majestie gave
to Mr. Bushell, but I beleeve long ere this time the dampnesse of the
place haz spoyled it with mouldinesse.

Memorandum:--the grotto[518] belowe lookes just south; so that when it
artificially raineth, upon the turning of a cock, you are enterteined
with a rainebowe. In a very little pond (no bigger then a basin)
opposite to the rock, and hard by, stood (1643, Aug. 8) a Neptune,
neatly cutt in wood, holding his trident in his hand, and ayming with
it at a duck which perpetually turned round with him, and a spanniel
swimming after her--which was very pretty, but long since spoyled. I
heare that ... earl of Rochester, in whose possession it now is, doeth
keepe it very well in order.

[519]Mr. Bushell was the greatest arts-master to runne in dept
(perhaps) in the world. He died one hundred and twenty thousand pounds
in dept. He had so delicate a way of making his projects alluring and
feazible, profitable, that he drewe to his baites not only rich men of
no designe, but also the craftiest knaves in the countrey, such who had
cosened and undon others: e.g. Mr. Goodyeere, who undid Mr. Nicholas
Mees's father, etc.

Vide _Plea for Irish cattle_.

Vide[520] φ p. 148, Bushell's rocks.

Quaere his servant John Sydenham for the collection of remarques of
severall partes of England, by the said Mr. Bushell.

[521]Memorandum:--his ingeniose invention of _aditus_ with bellowes
to bring fresh aire into the mines: quaere Mr. Beech (quaker) if he
hath his printed booke or where it may be had. He gave one to Sir John
Danvers, which was nayled in the parlour to the wainscot: 'twas but
about 8 sheetes.

Quaere Dr. Plott (<author of> Antiquities of Oxonshire) of the booke
I gave him some yeares since of the songs and entertainment of Mr.
Bushell to queen Henrietta Marie at his rocks. If he had it not,
perhaps Anthony Wood had it. Mr. E<dmund> W<yld> sayes that he tap't
the mountaine of Snowdon in ... in Wales, which was like to have
drowned all the countrey; and they were like to knock him and his men
in the head.

Mr. Thomas Bushell lay some time (perhaps yeares) at Capt. Norton's,
in the gate at Scotland-yard, where he dyed seven yeares since (now,
1684), about 80 aetat. Buried in the little cloysters at Westminster
Abbey: vide the Register. Somebody putt[522] B. B. upon the
stone[XXXI.].--From Mr. Beech the quaker.

[XXXI.] Now, 1687, gon: all new paved.


_Notes._

[BM] 'Nailed,' I suppose, after the fashion of nailing counterfeit
coins to the counter, or vermin to the stable door. Sir John Danvers
had probably lost money in the 'scheme.'

[BN] Stephen Goodall, chaplain of Ch. Ch., died in Oxford, in Sept.
1637.--Griffiths' _Index to Wills ... at Oxford_, p. 24.

Anthony Wood says the music was composed by Samuel Ives. Aubrey's copy
of these poems is now among Anthony Wood's books in the Bodleian.




=Samuel Butler= (1612/3-1680).


[523]Mr. Samuel Butler was[524] borne[XXXII.] at Pershore in
Worcestershire, as we suppose: his brother lives there.

[XXXII.] He was born in Worcestershire, hard by Barbon-bridge, 1/2 a
mile from Worcester, in the parish of St. John, Mr. Hill thinkes, who
went to schoole with him.

He went to schoole at Worcester--from Mr. Hill.

His father <was> a man but of slender fortune, and to breed him at
schoole was as much education as he was able to reach to. When[525] but
a boy he would make observations and reflections on every thing one
sayd or did, and censure it to be either well or ill. He never was at
the university, for the reason alledged.

He came when a young man to be a servant to the countesse of Kent, whom
he served severall yeares. Here, besides his study, he employed his
time much in painting and drawing, and also in musique. He was thinking
once to have made painting his profession--from Dr. Duke. His love to
and skill in painting made a great friendship between him and Mr.
Samuel Cowper (the prince of limners of this age).

He then studyed the Common Lawes of England, but did not practise. He
maried a good jointuresse, the relict of ... Morgan, by which meanes he
lives comfortably.

After the restauration of his majestie when the court at Ludlowe was
againe sett-up, he was then the king's steward at the castle there.

He printed a witty Poeme called _Hudibras_, the first part anno 166..
which tooke extremely[526]; so that the king and Lord Chancellor
Hyde[XXXIII.] would have him sent for, and accordingly he was sent for.
They both promised him great matters, but to this day he haz got _no_
employment, only the king gave him ... _li._

[XXXIII.] The Lord Chancellor Hyde haz his picture in his library over
the chimney.

He is of a middle stature, strong sett, high coloured, a head of
sorrell haire, a severe and sound judgement: a good fellowe. He haz
often sayd that way (e.g. Mr. Edmund Waller's) of quibling with sence
will hereafter growe as much out of fashion and be as ridicule as
quibling with words--quod N.B. He haz been much troubled with the gowt,
and particularly 1679, he stirred not out of his chamber from October
till Easter.

  Obiit Anno {Domini 1680 }.
             {circiter 70.}

He dyed of a consumption September 25; and buried 27, according to his
appointment[527], in the churchyard of Convent Garden; scil. in the
north part next the church at the east end. His feet touch the wall.
His grave, 2 yards distant from the pillaster of the dore, (by his
desire) 6 foot deepe.

About 25 of his old acquaintance at his funerall. I myself being one
[of[528] the eldest, helped to carry[529] the pall with Tom Shadwell,
at the foot, Sir Robert Thomas and Mr. Saunders, esq., at the head;
Dr. Cole and Dr. Davenant, middle]. His coffin covered with black bayes;

                            S. B. 1680[530].

[531]Insert in vita Sam. Butler his verses of the Jesuites, not
printed, which I gave to you[532] about 12 or 14.


[533]_Hudibras unprinted._

    No Jesuite ever took in hand,
    To plant a church in barren land;
    Or ever thought it worth his while
    A Swede or Russe to reconcile;
    For where there is not store of wealth,
    Souls are not worth the charge of health[534].
    Spaine and[d] America had two designes
    To sell their[535] Ghospell for their mines;
    For had the Mexicans been poore,
    No Spaniard twice had landed on their shore.
    'Twas gold the Catholick Religion planted,
    Which, had they wanted gold, they still had wanted.

He had made very sharp reflexions upon the court in his last
part[536]:--

    Did not the learned Glynne and Maynard
    To prove true subjects traytors straine hard?

[537]Mr. Saunders (the countesse of Kent's kinsman) sayd that Mr. John
Selden much esteemed him for his partes, and would sometimes employ him
to write letters for him beyond sea, and to translate for him. He was
secretarie to the duke of Bucks, when he was Chancellor of Cambridge.
He might have had preferments at first; but he would not accept any but
very good ones, so at last he had none at all, and dyed in want.

He painted well and made it (sometime) his profession.

He wayted some yeares on the countess of Kent: she gave her gentlemen
20_li._ per annum a-piece. Mr. John Selden tooke notice of his partes
and would many times make him write or translate for him.

Obiit sine prole.

[538]Samuel Butler writt my lord [John[539]] Rosse's Answer to
[Robert[540]] the marquesse of Dorchester.

Memorandum:--satyricall witts disoblige whom they converse with, etc.;
and consequently make to themselves many enemies and few friends; and
this was his manner and case. He was of a leonine-coloured haire,
sanguino-cholerique, middle sized, strong.




=William Butler= (1535-1617/8).


[541]...[542] Butler, physitian; he was of Clare-hall in Cambridge,
never tooke the degree of Doctor, though he was the greatest physitian
of his time.

The occasion of his being first taken notice of was
thus[XXXIV.]:--About the comeing-in of[543] king James, there was
a minister of ... (a few miles from Cambridge), that was to preach
before his majestie at New-market. The parson heard that the king was a
great scholar, and studyed so excessively that he could not sleep, so
somebody gave him some opium, which had made him sleep his last, had
not Dr. Butler[544] used this following remedy. He was sent for by the
parson's wife. When he came and sawe the parson, and asked what they
had donne, he told her that she was in danger to be hanged for killing
her husband, and so in great choler left her. It was at that time when
the cowes came into the backside to be milk't. He turnes back, and
asked whose cowes those were. She sayd <her> husband's[545]. Sayd he,
'will you give one of these cowes to fetch your husband to life again?'
That she would, with all her heart. He then causes one presently to be
killed and opened, and the parson[XXXV.] to be taken out of his bed and
putt into the cowes warme belly, which after some time brought him to
life, or els he had infallibly dyed.

[XXXIV.] From Edmund Waller, esqre.

[XXXV.] Quaere[546] E. W. or Gale, who?

Memorandum:--there is a parallell storie to this in Machiavell's
Florentiac History, where 'tis sayd that one of the Cosmo's being
poysoned was putt into a mule's belly, sowed up, with a place only for
his head to come out.

He was a humorist[547]. One time king James sent for him to New-market,
and when he was gon halfe way <he> left the messenger and turned back;
so then the messenger made him ride before him.

I thinke he was never maried. He lived in an apothecary's shop,
in Cambridge, <John> Crane, to whom he left his estate; and he in
gratitude erected the monument[548] for him, at his owne chardge, in
the fashion[549] he used. He was not greedy of money, except choice
pieces of gold or rarities.

He would many times (I have heard say) sitt among the boyes at
St. Maries church in Cambridge ( ☞ and just so would the famous
attorney-generall Noy, in Lincoln's Inne, who had many such froliques
and humours).

I remember Mr. Wodenoth, of King's College, told me, that being sent
for to ... ... he told him that his disease was not to be found in
Galen or Hippocrates, but in Tullie's Epistles, _Cum non sis ubi
fueris, non est cur velis vivere_.

I thinke he left his estate to the apothecarie. He gave to the chapell
of Clare-hall, a bowle[550], for the communion, of gold (cost, I
thinke, 2 or 300 _li._), on which is engraved a pelican feeding her
young with the bloud from her breast (an embleme of the passion of
Christ), no motto, for the embleme explained it selfe.

He lies buried in the south side of St. Marie's chancell, in Cambridge,
wher is a decent monument, with his body halfe way, and an inscription,
which gett.

He was much addicted to his humours, and would suffer persons of
quality to wayte sometimes some houres at his dore, with coaches,
before he would recieve them. Once, on the rode from Cambridge to
London, he tooke a fancy to a chamberlayn or tapster in his inne, and
tooke him with him, and made him his favourite, by whom only accession
was to be had to him, and thus enriched him. Dr. Gale[BO], of Paul's
schoole, assures me that a French man came one time from London to
Cambridge, purposely to see him, whom he made stay two howres for him
in his gallery, and then he came out to him in an old blew gowne; the
French gentleman makes him 2 or 3 very lowe bowes downe to the ground;
Dr. Butler whippes his legge over his head, and away goes into his
chamber, and did not speake with him.

He kept an old mayd whose name was Nell. Dr. Butler would many times
goe to the taverne, but drinke by himselfe. About 9 or 10 at night old
Nell comes for him with a candle and lanthorne, and sayes 'Come you
home, you drunken beast.' By and by Nell would stumble; then her master
calls her 'drunken beast'; and so they did _drunken beast_ one another
all the way till they came home.

[551]A serving man brought his master's water to doctor Butler, being
then in his studie (with turn'd barres) but would not bee spoken
with. After much fruitlesse importunity, the man told the doctor he
was resolved he should see his master's water; he would not be turned
away--threw it on the Dr's. head. This humour pleased the Dr. and he
went to the gent. and cured him--<from> Mr. R. Hooke.

A gent. lying a-dyeing, sent his servant with a horse for the doctor.
The horse being exceeding dry, ducks downe his head strongly into the
water, and plucks downe the Dr. over his head, who was plunged in the
water over head and eares. The Dr. was madded, and would returne home.
The man swore he should not; drew his sword, and gave him ever and
anon (when he would returne) a little prick, and so drove him before
him--<from> Mr. ... Godfrey.

[552]Some instances of Dr. Butler's cures:--from Mr. James Bovey.--The
Dr. lyeing at the Savoy in London, next the water side, where was
a balcony look't into the Thames, a patient came to him that was
grievously tormented with an ague. The Dr. orders a boate to be in
readinesse under his windowe, and discoursed with the patient (a
gentleman) in the balcony, when on a signall given, 2 or 3 lusty
fellowes came behind the gentleman and threw him a matter of 20 feete
into the Thames. This surprize absolutely cured him.

A gentleman with a red, ugly, pumpled face came to him for a cure. Said
the Dr., '_I must hang you_.' So presently he had a device made ready
to hang him from a beame in the roome; and when he was e'en almost
dead, he cutts the veines that fed these pumples, and lett-out the
black ugly bloud, and cured him.

Another time one came to him for the cure of a cancer (or ulcer) in the
bowells. Said the Dr., 'can ye----?' 'Yes,' said the patient. So the
Dr. ordered a bason for him to----, and when he had so donne the Dr.
commanded him to eate it up. This did the cure.


[553]_Inscription on his monument[554]._

This inscription was sent to me by my learned and honoured friend, Dr.
Henry More, of Cambridge.

=Cecil Calvert=, 2nd baron Baltimore (1606-1675).


[562]Cecil Calvert, lord Baltemore, absolute lord and proprietary of
Maryland and Avalon in America, son to <George> Calvert (secretary of
estate to king James), was gentleman-commoner of Trinity College, Oxon,
contemporary with Mr. Francis Potter, B.D.

[563]Now if I would be rich, I could be a prince. I could goe into
Maryland, which is one of the finest countrys of the world; same
climate with France; between Virginia and New England. I can have all
the favour of my lord Baltemore I could wish.--His brother is his
lieutenant there; and a very good natured gentleman.--Plenty of all
things: ground there is 2000 miles westwards.

I could be able I believe to carry a colony of rogues; another, of
ingeniose artificers; and I doubt not one might make a shift to have 5
or 6 ingeniose companions, which is enough.




=William Camden= (1551-1623).


[564]Mr. William Camden, Clarencieux--vide Fuller's _Holy State_ where
is something of his life and birth, etc.: vide _England's Worthies_:
quaere at the Heralds' Office when he was made Clarencieux.

Mr. Edward Bagshawe (who had been second schoole-master of Westminster
schoole) haz told me that Mr. Camden had first his place and his
lodgeings (which is the gate-house by the Queen's Scholars' chamber
in Deanes-yard), and was after made the head schoole-master of that
schoole, where he writt and taught _Institutio Græcae Grammatices
Compendiaria: in usum Regiae Scholae Westmonasteriensis_, which is now
the common Greeke grammar of England, but his name is not sett to it.
Before, they learned the prolix Greeke Grammar of Cleonard.

He writt his _Britannia_ first in a large 8º.

_Annales reg. Elizabethae._

There is a little booke in 16mo. of his printed, viz.: A Collection of
all the Inscriptions then on the Tombes in Westminster Abbey.

'Tis reported, that he had bad eies[565] (I guesse lippitude) which was
a great inconvenience to an antiquary.

Mr. Nicholas Mercator has Stadius's _Ephemerides_, which had been one
of Mr. Camden's; his name is there (I knowe his hand) and there are
some notes by which I find he was astrologically given.

In his _Britannia_ he haz a remarkable astrologicall observation, that
when Saturn is in Capricornus a great plague is certainly in London. He
had observed it all his time, and setts downe the like made by others
before his time. Saturn was so posited in the great plague 1625, and
also in the last great plague 1665. He likewise delivers that when an
eclipse happens in ... that 'tis fatall to the towne of Shrewsbury,
for....

He was basted by a courtier of the queene's in the cloysters at
Westminster for ... queen Elizabeth in his history--from Dr. John
Earle, dean of Westminster.

My honoured and learned friend, Thomas Fludd, esq., a Kentish
gentleman, (<aged> 75, 1680) was neighbour and an acquaintance to Sir
Robert Filmore, in Kent, who was very intimately acquainted with Mr.
Camden, who told Sir Robert that he was not suffered to print many
things in his _Elizabetha_, which he sent over to his acquaintance and
correspondent Thuanus, who printed it all faithfully in his _Annalls_
without altering a word--quod N. B.

He lies buried in the South cross-aisle of Westminster Abbey, his
effigies 1/2 on an altar, with this inscription:--

                   Qui fide antiqua et opera assidua
                  Britannicam antiquitatem indagavit
                         Simplicitatem innatam

in his hand a booke, on the leaves wherof is writt BRITANNIA.

Mr. Camden much studied the Welsh language, and kept a Welsh servant
to improve him <in> that language, for the better understanding of our
antiquities.--From Mr. Samuel Butler.

[566]Sir William Dugdale tells me that he haz minutes of King James's
life to a moneth and a day, written by Mr. William Camden; as also his
owne life, according to yeares and daye, which is very briefe, but 2
sheetes, Mr. Camden's owne hand writing. Sir William Dugdale had it
from <John> Hacket[XXXVI.], bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, who did
filch it from Mr. Camden as he lay a dyeing.

[XXXVI.] ☞ Quaere Sir William Dugdale. Vide how bishop Hacket came by
it.

[567]Quaere Mr. Ashmole to retrive and looke out Mr. Camden's minutes
(memorandums) of King James I from his entrance into England, which Dr.
Thorndyke[XXXVII.] filched from him as he lay a dyeing. 'Tis not above
6 or 8 sheetes of paper, as I remember. Those memoires were continued
within a fortnight of his death.

[XXXVII.] He (Dr. Th.) told Sir Wiliam Dugdale so, who told me of it.

[568]Quaere Dr. Buzby if Mr. Camden ever resigned the schoolmaster's
place[569]? And if he did not dye at Westminster at the schoole
house--vide bishop Hackett's life, which is printed before his sermons.

[570]Memorandum:--Mr. Camden's nativity is in his Memoires of King
James, which gett.

[571]William Camden: quaere Sir William Dugdale who haz his papers?

Anthony Wood's lettre sayth that some of them are in Sir Henry St.
George's hands[572], 'written and tricked with Mr. Camden's owne hand':
ergo quaere ibidem.

[573]When my grandfather[574] went to schoole at Yatton-Keynell (neer
Easton-Piers) Mr. Camden came to see the church, and particularly
tooke notice of a little painted-glasse-windowe in the chancell, which
(ever since my remembrance) haz been walled-up, to save the parson the
chardge of glazing it.




=William Canynges= (1399-1474).


[575]The antiquities of the city of Bristowe doe very well deserve some
antiquarie's paines (and the like for Gloucester). Here were a great
many religious houses. The collegiate church (priorie of Augustines) is
very good building, especially the gate-house. The best built churches
of any city in England, before these new ones at London since the
conflagration. Severall monuments and inscriptions.

Ratliff church (which was intended[576] for a chapel) is an admirable
piece of architecture of about Henry VII's time. It was built by
alderman ... Canning, who had fifteen shippes of his owne (or 16).
He gott his estate chiefly by carrying of pilgrims to St. Jago of
Compostella. He had a fair house in Ratliff Street that lookes towards
the water side, ancient Gothique building, a large house that, 1656,
was converted to a glasse-house. See the annotations on Norton's
Ordinall in _Theatrum Chemicum_, where 'tis sayd that Thomas Norton
of Bristow got the secret of the philosopher's stone from alderman
Canning's widow.

This alderman Canning did also build and well endow the religious house
at Westbury or Henbury (vide Speede's mappe and chronicle); 'tis about
two or three miles from Bristowe in the rode to Aust-passage.

In his old age he retired to this house and entred into that order.
He built his owne monument at his church at Ratcliff where is an
inscription, which gett[BR]; ☞ but he was not interred there but at
Westbury.


_Note._

[BR] See J. Britton's Historical and Architectural essay relating to
Redcliffe Church, Bristol, with plans, views, account of its monuments,
&c. 1813.




=William Cartwright= (1611-1643).


[577]William Cartwright, M.A., Aedis Christi, Oxon., natus juxta
Teuxbury in com. Glocestriae, September, 1611; baptizatus[578] 26 Sept.

[579]Glocestershire is famous for the birth of William Cartwright at
a place called Northway neer Tewksbury. Were he alive now he would be
sixty-one.

He writt a treatise of metaphysique--quaere Dr. <Thomas> Barlowe, etc.,
de hoc: as also of his sermons, particularly the sermon that by the
king's command he preached at his returne from Edge-hill fight.

'Tis not to be forgott that king Charles 1st dropt a teare at the newes
of his death.

William Cartwright was buried in the south aisle in Christ Church,
Oxon. Pitty 'tis so famous a bard should lye without an inscription.

[580]William Cartwright was borne at Northway neer Tewksbury,
Gloucestershire--this I have from his brother, who lives not far from
me[581], and from his sisters whom I called upon in Glocestershire at
Leckhamton. His sister Howes was 57 yeares old the 10 March last: her
brother William was 4 yeares older.

His father was a gentleman of 300 _li._ per annum. He kept his inne
at Cirencester, but a year or therabout, where he declined and lost
by it too. He had by his wife 100 _li._ per annum, in Wiltshire,
an impropriation, which his son has now (but having many children,
lives not handsomely and haz lost his learning: he was by the second
wife, whose estate this was). Old Mr. Cartwright lived sometime at
Leckhampton, Gloc., wher his daughters now live.




=Lucius Cary=, viscount Falkland (1610-1643).


[582]Lucius Carey[BS], second lord Falkland, was the eldest son of Sir
Henry Carey, Lord Lievetenant of Ireland, the first viscount Falkland.

His mother was daughter and heir of Sir <Laurence> Tanfield, Lord
Chief Baron of the Exchequer, by whom he had Great Tue, in Oxfordshire
(formerly the Rainesfords), and the Priory of Burford, in Oxfordshire,
which he sold to <William> Lenthall, the Speaker of the Long Parliament.

He was borne ... (quaere); had his University education at the
University of Dublin, in Ireland. He travelled, and had one Mr. ... (a
very discreet gentleman) to be his governor[BT], whom he respected to
his dyeing day.

He maried Letice, the daughter of Sir <Richard> Morison, by whom he had
two sonnes: the eldest lived to be a man, died _sine prole_; the second
was father to this lord Falkland now living.

This lady Letice was a good and pious lady, as you may see by her
life writt about 1649, or 50, by ... Duncomb, D.D. But I will tell
you a pretty story from William Hawes, of Trin. Coll., who was well
acquainted with the governor aforesaid, who told him that my lady was
(after the manner of woemen) much governed by, and indulgent to, the
nursery; when she had a mind to beg any thing of my lord for one of
her woemen[583] (nurses, or &c.); she would not doe it by herselfe
(if she could helpe it), but putt this gentleman upon it, to move it
to my lord. My lord had but a small estate for his title; and the
old gentleman would say, 'Madam, this is so unreasonable a motion to
propose to my lord, that I am certaine he will never graunt it';--e.g.
one time to lett a farme[584] twenty pound per annum under value. At
length, when she could not prevaile on him, she would say that, 'I
warrant you, for all this, I will obtaine it of my lord; _it will
cost me but the expence of a few teares_.' Now she would make her
words good; and this great witt, the greatest master of reason and
judgement of his time, at the long runne, being storm'd by her _teares_
(I presume there were kisses and secret embraces that were also
ingredients), would this pious lady obtain her unreasonable desires of
her poor lord.

    Haec verba, me hercule, una falsa lacrumula,
    Quam, oculos terendo misere, vix vi expresserit,
    Restinguet.

                         TERENT. _Eunuch._ Act 1, Scene 1.

N.B.:--my lord in his youth was very wild, and also mischievous, as
being apt to stabbe and doe bloudy mischiefs; but 'twas not long before
he tooke-up to be serious, and then grew to be an extraordinary hard
student. I have heard Dr. Ralph Bathurst[XXXVIII.] say that, when he
was a boy, my lord lived at Coventrey (where he had then a house), and
that he would sett up very late at nights at his study, and many times
came to the library at the schoole[XXXIX.] there.

[XXXVIII.] A mayd that lived with my lord lived with his father[BU].

[XXXIX.] There is Euclid's Harmoniques written with Philemon Holland's
owne hand, in a curious Greeke character; he was schoolmaster here.

The studies in fashion in those dayes (in England) were poetry, and
controversie with the church of Rome. My lord's mother was a zealous
papist, who being very earnest to have her son of her religion, and
her son upon that occasion, labouring hard to find the[585]trueth, was
so far at last from setling on the Romish church, that he setled and
rested in the Polish (I meane Socinianisme). He was the first Socinian
in England; and Dr. <Hugh> Crescy, of Merton Coll. (dean of <Leighlin>
in Ireland, afterwards a Benedictin monke), a great acquaintance of
my lord's in those dayes (anno ...), told me, at Samuel Cowper's
(1669), that he himselfe was the first that brought Socinus's bookes
(anno ...); shortly after, my lord comeing to him, and casting his eie
on them, would needs presently borrow them, to peruse; and was so
extremely taken and satisfied with them, that from that time was his
conversion.

My lord much lived at Tue, which is a pleasant seat, and about 12
miles from Oxford; his lordship was acquainted with the best witts of
that University, and his house was like a Colledge, full of learned
men[586]. Mr. William Chillingworth, of Trinity College in Oxford
(afterwards D.D.), was his most intimate and beloved favourite, and
was most commonly with my lord; next I may reckon (if not equall) Mr.
John Earles, of Merton College (who wrote the Characters); Dr. <George>
Eglionby, of Ch. Ch., was also much in esteem with his lordship. His
chaplaine, Charles Gataker, (filius <Thomae> Gataker of Redriff,
a writer), was an ingeniose young gentleman, but no writer[587].
For learned gentlemen of the country, his acquaintance was Sir H.
Rainesford, of ... neer Stratford-upon-Avon, now ... (quaere Tom
Mariet); Sir Francis Wenman[588], of Caswell, in Witney parish; Mr. ...
Sandys, the traveller and translator (who was uncle to my lady Wenman);
Ben. Johnson (vide Johnsonus Virbius, where he haz verses, and 'twas
his lordship, Charles Gattaker told me, that gave the name to it);
Edmund Waller, esq.; Mr. Thomas Hobbes, and all the excellent[589] of
that peaceable time.

In the civill warres he adhered to King Charles I, who after
Edge-hill fight made him Principall Secretary of Estate (with Sir
Edward Nicholas), which he dischardged with a great deale of witt
and prudence, only his advice was very unlucky to his Majestie, in
perswading him (after the victory[590] at Rowndway-downe, and the
taking of Bristowe), to sitt-downe before Glocester, which was so
bravely defended by that incomparably vigilant governor coll....
Massey, and the diligent and careful soldiers, and citizens (men and
woemen), that it so broke and weakned the king's army, that 'twas the
procatractique cause of his ruine: vide Mr. Hobbes. After this, all
the King's matters went worse and worse. Anno domini 164<3> at the
... fight (quaere which) at Newbery, my lord Falkland being there,
and having nothing to doe to chardge; as the 2 armies were engageing,
rode in like a mad-man (as he was) between them, and was (as he
needs must be) shott. Some that[591] were your superfine discoursing
politicians and fine gentlemen, would needs have the reason of this
mad action of throwing away his life so, to be his discontent for the
unfortunate advice given to his master as aforesaid; but, I have been
well enformed, by those that best knew him, and[592] knew the intrigues
behind the curtaine (as they say), that it was the griefe of the death
of Mris ... Moray, a handsome lady at court, who was his mistresse,
and whom he loved above all creatures, was the true cause of his being
so madly guilty of his own death, as afore mentioned: (_nullum magnum
ingenium sine mixtura dementiae_).

The next day, when they went to bury the dead, they could not find his
lordship's body, it was stript, trod-upon, and mangled; so there was
one that had wayted on him in his chamber would undertake to know it
from all other bodyes, by a certaine mole his lordship had in his neck,
and by that marke did find it. He lies interred in the ... at Great
Tue aforesaid, but, I thinke, yet without any monument; quaere if any
inscription.

In the dining roome there is a picture of his at length, and like him
('twas donne by Jacob de Valke, who taught me to paint). He was but a
little man, and of no great strength of body; he had blackish haire,
something flaggy, and I thinke his eies black. Dr. Earles would not
allow him to be a good poet, though a great witt; he writt not a smoth
verse, but a greate deal of sense. He hath writt....

He had an estate in Hertfordshire, at ..., which came by Morrison (as
I take it); sold not long before the late civill warres.


_Notes._

[BS] Aubrey gives in trick the coat 'argent, on a bend sable, 3 roses
of the field [Cary],' surmounted with a viscount's coronet and wreathed
with laurel for a poet.

[BT] A pencil note in the margin says: 'quaere Baron Berty'; perhaps
Vere Bertie, Puisne Baron of the Exchequer, 1675. The query would be
for the name of the tutor on the foreign tour.

[BU] i.e. a maid, formerly in Lucius, lord Falkland's service, came
into service with Dr. Bathurst's father, and told of his lordship's
late studies.




=Sir Charles Cavendish= (16..-1652?).


[593](From Mr. John Collins, mathematician:--) Sir Charles
Cavendish[BV] was borne at ..., the younger brother to William, duke of
Newcastle. He was a little, weake, crooked man, and nature having not
adapted him for the court nor campe, he betooke himselfe to the study
of the mathematiques, wherin he became a great master. His father left
him a good estate, the revenue wherof he expended on bookes and on
learned men.

He had collected in Italie, France, &c., with no small chardge, as
many manuscript mathematicall bookes as filled a hoggeshead, which he
intended to have printed; which if he had live<d> to have donne, the
growth of mathematicall learning had been 30 yeares or more forwarder
then 'tis. But he died of the scurvey, contracted by hard study, about
1652 (quaere), and left one Mr. ..., an attorney of Clifford's Inne,
his executor, who shortly after died, and left his wife executrix, who
sold this incomparable collection aforesaid by weight to the past-board
makers for wast paper. ☞ A good caution for those that have good MSS.
to take care to see them printed in their life-times.

He dyed ... and was buried in the vault of the family of the duke of
Newcastle, at Bolsover, in the countie of <Derby>.

He is mentioned by Mersennus. Dr. John Pell (who knew him, and made him
one of his XII jurymen contra Longomontanum) tells me that he writt
severall things in mathematiques for his owne pleasure.


_Note._

[BV] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'sable, 3 bucks' heads caboshed
argent [Cavendish]; quartering, argent, a fess between 3 crescents
gules [Ogle], a crescent on the fess point for difference,' with the
motto _Cavendo tutus_.




=Charles Cavendish=, Colonel, (1620-1643).


[594]Charles Cavendish, colonel, was second son to the right honourable
<William, 2nd> earle of Devonshire, brother to this present earle,
William.

He was borne at ... anno.... He was well educated, and then travelled
into France, Italie, &c.; but was so extremely delighted in travelling,
that he went into Greece, all over; and that would not serve his turne
but he would goe to Babylon, and then his governour would not adventure
to goe any further with him; but to see Babylon he was to march in the
Turks' armie. This account I had many yeares since, scilicet 1642, from
my cosen Edmund Lyte, who was then gentleman usher to his mother the
countesse dowager.

Mr. Thomas Hobbes told me that this Mr. Cavendish told him that the
Greekes doe sing their Greeke.--In Herefordshire they have a touch
of this singing; our old divines had. Our old vicar of Kington St.
Michael, Mr. Hynd, did sing his sermons rather then reade them. You
may find in Erasmus that the monkes used this fashion, who mocks them,
that sometimes they would be very lowe, and by and by they would be
mighty high, _quando nihil opus est_.--Anno 1660 comeing one morning
to Mr. Hobbes, his Greeke Xenophon lay open on the board: sayd he,
'Had you come but a little sooner you had found a Greeke here that
came to see me, who understands the old Greeke; I spake to him to read
here in this booke, and he sang it; which putt me in mind of what Mr.
Charles Cavendish told me' (as before); 'the first word is Ἔννοια,
he pronounced it _e̓́nnia_.' The better way to explaine it is by
prick-song,

[Illustration: Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος · ἄνθρωπος.]

[595]Upon his returne into England the civill warres brake-out, and
he tooke a comission of a colonel in his majestie's cause, wherin
he did his majestie great service, and gave signall proofes of his
valour;--e.g. out of _Mercurii Aulici_--

    Grantham, in Lincolnshire, taken by col. Cavendish for the
    king, 23 March, 1642/3, and after demolished.--Young Hotham
    routed at Ancaster by col. Cavendish, 11 Apr. 1643.--Parliament
    forces routed or defeated at Dunnington by col. Cavendish, 13
    June, 1643.

    _Mercurius Aulicus_, Tuesday, Aug. 1, 1643; 'It was advertised
    from Newarke that his majestie's forces having planted
    themselves at the siege of Gainsborough in com. Linc., were
    sett upon by the united powers of Cromwell, Nottingham, and
    Lincolne, the garrisons of these townes being almost totally
    drawn-out to make-up this army, which consisted of 24 troupes
    of horse and dragoons. Against this force, col. Cavendish
    having the command of 30 troupes of horse and dragoons,
    drawes out 16 only, and leaving all the rest for a reserve,
    advanced towards them, and engaged himselfe with this small
    partie against all their strength. Which being observed by
    the rebells, they gott between him and his reserve, routed
    his 16 troupes, being forespent with often watches, killed
    lievetenant-colonel Markam, most valiantly fighting in defence
    of his king and countrey. The most noble and gallant colonel
    himselfe, whilest he omitted no part of a brave commander,
    being cutt most dangerously in the head, was struck-off his
    horse, and so unfortunately shott with a brace of bullets after
    he was on the ground, whose life was most pretious to all noble
    and valiant gentlemen. Wherupon the reserve coming, routed and
    cutt downe the partie.'

This was donne either the 28 or 29 of July, 1643, for upon this
terrible rout, the lord Willoughby of Parham forthwith yealded
Gainsborough to the king's partie, July 30; the earle of Newcastle
being then generall of that partie.

His body was first buried at ...,[XL.] but by order of his mother's
will, when she was buried at Darby (where she has erected a noble
monument for herselfe and lord) she ordered her sonne's body to be
removed, and both to be layd in the vault there together, which was
Feb. 18, 1674.

[XL.] Quaere if at Gainsborough or Newark? as I remember 'twas Newarke.

Funerall Sermon, by William Naylour, her chaplain, preached at Darby,
Feb. 18, 1674. Lond. for Henry Broome. Texte, 2 Sam. iii. 38th
verse.--page 16:

    'He was the souldiers' mignion, and his majestie's darling,
    designed by him generall of the northern horse (and his
    commission was given him), a great marke of honour for one of
    about five and twenty: "thus shall it be donne to the man whom
    the king delights to honour."

    'Col. Cavendish was a princely person, and all his actions were
    agreable to that character: he had in an eminent degree that
    which the Greekes call εἶδος ἄξιον τυραννίδος, the semblance
    and appearance of a man made to governe. Methinkes he gave
    cleare this indication, the king's cause lived with him, the
    king's cause died with him--when Cromwell heard that he was
    slaine, he cried upon it _We have donne our businesse_.

    'And yet two things (I must confess) this commander knew not,
    pardon his ignorance,--he knew not to flie away--he knew
    not how to aske quarter--though an older did, I meane ...
    Henderson; for when this bold person entred Grantham on the one
    side, that wary gentleman, who should have attaqued it, fled
    away on the other. If Cato thought it usurpation in Caesar to
    give him his life, Cavendish thought it a greater for traytors
    and rebells of a common size to give him his. This brave hero
    might be opprest, (as he was at last by numbers) but he could
    not be conquered; the dying words of Epaminondas will fitt him,
    _Satis vixi, invictus etiam morior_.

    [596]'What wonders might have been expected from a commander so
    vigilant, so loyall, so constant, had he not dropt downe in his
    blooming age? But though he fell in his green yeares, he[597]
    fell a prince, and a great one too, in this respect greater
    then Abner; for Abner, that son of Mars, deserved his father's
    epithite, ἀλλοπρόσαλλος, _one of both sides_, first he setts-up
    Isbosheth, and then deserts him. Whereas Cavendish merited such
    a statue as the Roman senate decreed L. Vitellius, and the same
    inscription, _Pietatis immobilis erga Principem_, one whose
    loyaltie to his great master nothing could shake.

    'Secondly, consider the noble Charles Cavendish in his
    extraction, and so he is a branch of that family, of which some
    descended that are kings of Scotland: this the word _Fuimus_
    joyned to his maternall[XLI.] coate does plainly point at--not
    to urge at this time his descent by the father's side from one
    of the noblest families in England. An high extraction to some
    persons is like the dropsie, the greatnesse of the man is his
    disease, and renders him unweildie; but here is a person of
    great extract free from the swelling of greatness, as brisk
    and active as the lightest horseman that fought under him. In
    some parts of India, they tell us, that a nobleman accounts
    himselfe polluted if a plebeian touch him; but here is a
    person of that rank who used the same familiaritie[XLII.] and
    frankness amongst the meanest of his souldiers, the poorest
    miner, and amongst his equalls; and by stooping so low, he rose
    the higher in the common account, and was valued accordingly as
    a prince[598], and a great one; thus Abner and Cavendish run
    parallell in their titles and appellations.

    [XLI.] His mother was daughter to the lord Bruce, whose ancestors had
been kings of Scotland.

    [XLII.] Sir Robert Harley (son), an ingeniose gent. and expert
soldier, haz often sayd, that (generally) the commanders of the king's
army would never be acquainted with their soldiers, which was an
extraordinary prejudice to the kings cause. A captaine's good look, or
good word (some times), does infinitely winne them, and oblige them;
and he would say 'twas to admiration how souldiers will venture their
lives for an obligeing officer.--quod N. B.

    'Consider Abner in the manner of his fall, that was by a
    treacherous hand, and so fell Cavendish. II Sam. iii. 27, "and
    when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab tooke him aside in the
    gate to speake with him quietly, and smote him there under
    the fifth rib, that he died, for the bloud of Asahel[599] his
    brother." Thus fell Abner; and thus Cavendish,--the colonell's
    horse being mired in a bog at the fight before Gainsborough,
    1643, the rebels surround him, and take him prisoner; and
    after he was so, a base raskall comes behind him, and runs him
    through. Thus fell two great men by treacherous handes.

    'Thirdly and lastly, the place of his fall, that was in
    Israel.... Here Abner fell in his, and Cavendish fell in
    our Israel--the Church of England.... In this Church brave
    Cavendish fell, and what is more then that, in this Churches
    quarrel....

    'Thus I have compared colonel Cavendish with Abner, a fighting
    and a famous man in Israel; you see how he does equal, how he
    does exceed him.'




=John Cecil=, 4th earl of Exeter (1628-1678).


[600]... Cecil, earl of Exeter (quaere my lord chief baron Montagu[601]
de nomine Christiano[602]), earle of Exeter, translated monsieur
Balsac's letters, as appeares by his epistle to my lord in the first
volumne, lib. V, lettre V, and Vol. 2ᵈ, lib. V, lettre VI--'et je suis
sans doute beaucoup plus honneste homme en Angleterre qu'en France,
puisque j'y parle par vostre bouche.'




=William Cecil=, lord Burghley (1520-1598).


[603]Cecil, lord Burleigh:--Memorandum, the true name is _Sitsilt_,
and is an ancient Monmouthshire family, but now come to be about the
size[604] of yeomanry. In the church at Monmouth, I remember in a south
windowe an ancient scutcheon of the family, the same that this family
beares. 'Tis strange that they should be so vaine to leave off an old
British name for a Romancy one, which I beleeve Mr. Verstegan did putt
into their heads, telling his lordship, in his booke, that they were
derived from the ancient Roman _Cecilii_.

The first lord Burley (who was Secretary of Estate) was at first but
<a> country-schoole-master, and (I thinke Dr. Thomas Fuller sayes, vide
_Holy State_) borne in Wales.

I remember (when I was a schooleboy at Blandford) Mr. Basket, a
reverend divine, who was wont to beg us play-dayes, would alwayes
be[605] uncovered, and sayd that ''twas the lord Burleigh's custome,
_for_ (said he) _here is my Lord Chanceller, my Lord Treasurer, my Lord
Chief Justice, &c., predestinated_.'

'He made Cicero's Epistles his glasse, his rule, his oracle, and
ordinarie pocket-booke' (Dr. J. Web in preface of his translation of
Cicero's _Familiar Epistles_).




=Thomas Chaloner= (1595-1661).


[606]Thomas Chaloner[BW], esq., [bred[607] up in Oxon], was the <third>
son of Dr <Thomas> Chaloner, who was tutor (i.e. _informator_[608]) to
prince Henry (or prince Charles--vide bishop Hall's Letters de hoc).

He was a well-bred gentleman, and of very good naturall parts, and of
an agreable humour. He had the accomplishments of studies at home, and
travells in France, Italie, and Germanie.

About anno ... (quaere John Collins) riding a hunting in Yorkeshire
(where the allum workes now are), on a common, he[BX] tooke notice of
the soyle and herbage, and tasted the water, and found it to be like
that where he had seen the allum workes in Germanie. Wherupon he gott a
patent of the king (Charles I) for an allum worke (which was the first
that ever was in England), which was worth to him two thousand pounds
per annum, or better: but tempore Caroli Iᵐⁱ some courtiers did thinke
the profitt too much for him, and prevailed so with the king, that,
notwithstanding the patent aforesayd, he graunted a moeitie, or more,
to another (a courtier), which was the reason that made Mr. Chaloner so
interest himselfe for the Parliament-cause, and, in revenge, to be one
of the king's judges.

He was as far from a puritan as the East from the West. He was of the
naturall religion, and of Henry Martyn's gang, and one who loved to
enjoy the pleasures of this life. He was (they say) a good scholar,
but he wrote nothing that I heare of, onely an anonymous pamphlett,
8vo, scil. _An account of the Discovery of Moyses's Tombe_; which was
written very wittily. It was about 1652. It did sett the witts of all
the Rabbis of the Assembly then to worke, and 'twas a pretty while
before the shamme was detected, which was by ----.

He had a trick sometimes to goe into Westminster hall in a morning in
Terme time, and tell some strange story[609] (sham), and would come
thither again about 11 or 12 to have the pleasure to heare how it
spred; and sometimes it would be altered, with additions, he could
scarce knowe it to be his owne. He was neither proud nor covetous, nor
a hypocrite: not apt to doe injustice, but apt to revenge.

After the restauration of King Charles the Second, he[BY] kept the
castle at the Isle of Man[XLIII.], where he had a prettie wench that
was his concubine;[610] where when newes was brought him that there
were some come to the castle to demaund it for his majestie, he spake
to his girle to make him a posset, into which he putt, out of a paper
he had, some poyson, which did, in a very short time, make him fall a
vomiting exceedingly; and after some time vomited nothing but bloud.
His retchings were so violent that the standers by were much grieved to
behold it. Within three howres he dyed. The demandants of the castle
came and sawe him dead; he was swoln so extremely that they could not
see any eie he had, and no more of his nose then the tip of it, which
shewed like a wart, and his coddes were swoln as big as one's head.
This account I had from George Estcourt, D.D., whose brother-in-lawe,
... Hotham, was one of those that sawe him.

[XLIII.] This is a mistake. E<dmund> W<yld> esq. assures me that 'twas
JAMES CHALONER that dyed in the Isle of Man: and that THOMAS CHALONER
dyed or went beyond the sea; but which of them was the eldest brother
he knowes not, but he ghesses JAMES to be the elder, because he had
1500 _li._ per annum (circiter), which THOMAS had not.


_Notes._

[BW] Aubrey gives in trick the coat 'azure, 3 cherubs' heads or.' In
MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 6ᵛ, is a note:--'Is Chaloner's shield cum vel sine
chevron. Resp.--cum chevron, prout per seale.'

[BX] Anthony Wood assigns the discovery, and first working, of the
alum-mine to Thomas Chaloner the father, towards the end of Elizabeth's
reign.

[BY] Anthony Wood says that James Chaloner, brother of Thomas, poisoned
himself in 1660 at Peel Castle. Thomas died in 1661 at Middleburg in
Zeeland.

lettre, here inserted[620] before <the life of> Nicholas Mercator, p.

[621]_Concerning Mr. Charnocke._

  Sir,

Mr. Wells of Bridgewater performed his promise. He writes that the
house was lately pulled down, and is new built from the ground, all
except the wall at the east end. He could make nothing of what was only
left over the chimney; but he found the little dore that led out of the
lodging-chamber into the little _Athanor_ roome. Of that you have an
account in the enclosed draught.

The two roses I take to be the white and red, termes common with
Charnocke for the two magisteries. The two animals over them I suppose
are wolves, denoting the[622] ♁; abounding with a volatile[623] ☉ and
used for preparing and purifying one of the principal ingredients into
the worke. Out of it growes (if those authors may be credited) most
precious fruits.

I obliged a painter to goe over soon after I had been there and take
all he could find exactly. He was there, but I could never get anything
from him: an ingeniose man, but egregiously carelesse.

Looking back I find this noted by me--June 22, 1681; the place in the
_Athanor_ roome in which he kept his lampe was stone-work about 15
inches deep and so much square in the clear from side to side. Over it
a wooden collar with a rabit[624] as to lett-in a cover close. No place
to come into the square but by the collar, contrived probably after the
accident of burning his tabernacle mentioned in his printed pieces.

I find this added:--'Twas painted about the chimney thus:--on the left
side of the chimney proceeded from a red stalk streaked with white,
first, a paire of red branches, then a paire of white, then of red,
then one of white to the top; something like a rabbit's head painted
looking from the chimney to the foot of the sayd stalk.--The next
picture separated as by a pillar on the chimney:--from one stalke,
two white branches, of either side one; then two red, above; then two
white; then at the top this [Illustration:], the balls of a dusky
yellow.--The next picture is also distinguished by a pillar on the
chimney to the right side: this <is> quite obscured by smoake.

In the left corner of the roome another picture described, with double
branches, white, then red, then white, then one on the top red.

This is all I can say of that place, of which I wish I were capable of
sending a better account.

The other side of Mr. Wells's paper gives you one of the schemes in the
middle of the roll, which is now by me.

The transcription of the thing, said to be Ripley's, should cost Mr.
Ashmole nothing, were I not under an obligation not to impart it to
any. It may be greatly to his losse who did communicate it to me, if
the owner should know I have it. If I can contrive a way to send it
with leave I shall be ambitious to gratify that worthy person.

  your etc.
                            And. Paschall.

[625]To his much honoured friend John Aubrey, esqre., these present, at
Mr. Hooke's lodgeings in Gresham College, London.

  [626]Sir,

I received and returne thankes for yours.

Since my last I got leave to transcribe what Mr. Charnocke wrote on
the backside of the rolle, which I heer send you. I kept as neare as
I could to the very errours of his pen, by which it may in part be
seen that he was, as he professes, an _unlettered_ scholar. The inside
of the rolle (which is all in Latine, and perhaps the same with the
scrowle mentioned in _Theatrum Chemicum_, p. 375) was composed by a
great master in the Hermetic philosophy and written by a master of his
pen. Some notes written in void spaces of it by Mr. Charnocke's hand
shew he did not (at least throughly) understand it. But it seemes to me
that this rolle was a kind of _Vade mecum_ or manuall that the students
in that wisdome carryed about with them. I presume 'twas drawn out of
Raymund Lully, of which I shall be able to gaine fuller satisfaction
when I have his workes come down.

I was also, since my last, at Mr. Charnocke's house in Comag, where
the rolle was found; and saw the place where 'twas hid. I saw the
litle roome and contrivance he had for keeping his worke, and found
it ingeniosely ordered so as to prevent a like accident to that which
befell him New Yeare's day, 1555; and this pretty place joining as a
closet to his chamber was to make a servant needlesse and the worke
of giving attendance more easy to himselfe. I have also a litle iron
instrument found there which he made use of about his fire. I sawe on
the doore of his little _Athanor_-room, if I may so call it, drawn
by his own hand, with course colours and work, but ingeniously, an
embleme of his worke, at which I gave some guesses, and so about the
walls of his chamber. I thinke there was in all 5 panes of this worke,
all somewhat differing from each other, some very obscure and almost
worne out. They told me that people had been unwilling to dwell in that
house, because reputed troublesome,--I presume from some traditionall
storyes of this person, who was looked on by his neighbours as no
better than a conjurer.

As I was taking horse to come home from this pleasant entertainment, I
see a pretty ancient man come forth of the next doore. I asked him how
long he had lived there. Finding that it was the place of his birth, I
inquired if he had ever heard anything of that Mr. Charnocke. He told
me he had heard his mother (who dyed about 12 or 14 yeares since and
was 80 yeares of age at her decease) often speake of him; that he kept
a fire in, divers yeares; that his daughter lived with him; that once
he was gone forth, and by her neglect (whome he trusted it with in his
absence) the fire went out and so all his worke was lost; the brazen
head was very neare comeing to speake, but so was he disappointed.

I suppose the pleasant-humoured man--for that he was so appeares by
his breviary--alludeing to Frier Bacon's story, did so put off the
inquisitivenes of his simple neighbours, and thence it is come down
there by tradition till now.

Indeed it appeares by the inclosed lines that when he wrote the rolle
he had attained but to the white stone, which is perhaps not half the
way to the red,

('Put me to my sister Mercury, I congeale into silver'); and, if the
old woman's tale were true, he might afterwards be going on and be come
neare to the red and then that vexing accident might befall him; and
this might be, notwithstanding what is sayd in the fragment, referred
to the yeare 1574, for (being so neare the red as the traditionall
story sayes he was) he might see in that 50th yeare of his age that the
white was ferment to the red.

You may observe my calculation differs in one thing from Mr. Ashmole's
in his notes upon _Theatrum Chemicum_, p. 478: for he makes 'the
presse' to have been (out of Stowe) 1558, but I (out of Dr. Burnet's
History) 1557; and consequently he supposes the presse to have been
after the finishing of the Breviary, but I presume he set on the
Breviary after he was pressed. So indeed he himselfe plainly averres
in the 4 last lines of chapter 4 of his Breviary (_Theatrum Chemicum_,
p. 296). I mention this to give a reason for my dissenting from your
worthy friend, to whome I must intreat you to communicate these
informations that I have had opportunity to gather, and also present my
humble service.

  Sir,

I thought when I set pen to paper to have given you an account of
some conversation I have had with a person who is a zealous friend
and admirer of this sort of knowledge, but I see I have already gone
beyound bounds. I shal onely say he hath almost convinced me that it
is not so hidden and obscure, so difficult and unaccountable, as men
commonly seeme to beleeve. I am in hopes to receive, by Mr. Hooke's
and Mr. Lodwick's favour, the lamp for which he was pleased to give
directions some time since.

I have not yet seen my miller and his invention, though he promised to
bring it to me; I presume 'tis not yet ready. I expect him dayly.

Pray give my humble service to our worthy friend, and to Mr. Pigott.

I am sure I now need the[627]....

[628]I shall be glad to heare of a new edition of the _Theatrum_[629]
and that you will speed the printing of your MS. of Raymund Lullye's.
If it doe not goe soon to the presse, how joyfull should I be to have
the perusall of it! 'Tis the onely grievous thing I suffer in this
solitude that I may not see good bookes and good men, but I must be
content.

[630]The first thing written on the back side[631] is as followes:--

    At Stockeland, Bristowe, iiii myles from Brigewater, 1566.

    The principall rules of naturall philosophy figuratively set

Anno D. 1526--Thomas Charnocke borne at Feversham in Kent.

            He travailed all England over to gain his knowledge.

1554/5--He attained the secret from his master of Salisbury
              close, who dying left his worke with him.

            He lost it by fireing his tabernacle on a New Yeare's
              day.

            About this time being 28 yeares of age, he learned the
              secret againe of the prior of Bathe.

            He began anew with a servant, and againe by himselfe
              alone without a servant.

            He continued it nine monthes; was within a month of his
              reckoning; the crowe's head began to appear black.

1557--He, pressed on a warre proclaimed against the French
              (Burnet's History, part 2, p. 355), broke and cast
              all away. January 1, he began; July 20, he ended, his
              Breviary.

1562--He marryed Agnes Norden at Stockland, Bristoll.

1563--He buryed Absolon his son.

1566--He dedicated a booke to Queen Elizabeth 9 yeares after
              the Breviary was penned.

            He dated the rolle at Stockland.

1572--He wrote the posy on the rolle.

            He wrote his aenigma ad Alchimiam[638] and de
              Alchimia[639].

1573--the fragment[640] of 'knocke the child on the head.'

1574--that he never saw the white ferment to the red till that
              50th yeare of his age.

1576--the difficulty of the philosophick number in the roll.

1581--Buryed at Otterhampton neare Stockland out of his house at
              Comage where he kept his worke.

1587--Bridget Charnock (probably his daughter that kept his house
              when his fire was sayd to go out), marryed to one ...
              Thatcher in Stockland.

Collected out of the Roll, the register, and _Theatrum Chemicum_.




=Geoffrey Chaucer= (1328-1400).


[641]Sir Geffrey Chaucer: memorandum--Sir Hamond L'Estrange, of ..., in
... had his Workes in MS., a most curious piece, most rarely writt and
illumined, which he valued at 100 _li._ His grandson and heire still
haz it.--From Mr. Roger L'Estrange.

He taught his sonne the use of <the> astrolabe at 10; prout per his
treatise of the Astrolabe.

Dunnington Castle, neer Newbury, was his; a noble seate and strong
castle, which was held by the King (Charles Iˢᵗ) (who governour?) but
since dismanteled.

Memorandum:--neer this castle was an oake, under which Sir Jeofrey was
wont to sitt, called _Chaucer's-oake_, which was cutt downe by ...
... tempore Caroli Iᵐⁱ; and so it was, that ... ... was called into
the starre chamber, and was fined for it.... Judge Richardson[642]
harangued against him long, and like an orator, had topiques from the
Druides, etc. This information I had from ... an able attorney that was
at the hearing.

His picture is at his old howse at Woodstock (neer the parke-gate), a
foot high, halfe way: has passed from proprietor to proprietor.

[643]One Mr. Goresuch of Woodstock dined with us at Rumney marsh, who
told me that at the old Gothique-built howse neer the parke-gate at
Woodstock, which was the howse of Sir Jeffrey Chaucer, that there is
his picture, which goes with the howse from one to another--which see.




=William Chillingworth= (1602-1643/4).


[644]William Chillingworth[CA], D. D.,--vide Anthony Wood's _Antiq.
Oxon._ in Trinity College--was borne in Oxford. His father was a brewer.

About anno ... he was acquainted with one ... who drew him and some
other scholars over to Doway, where he was not so well entertained as
he thought he merited for his great disputative witt. They made him the
porter (which was to trye his temper, and exercise his obedience): so
he stole over and came to Trinity College againe, where he was fellowe.

William Laud, A. B. C.[645], was his godfather and great friend.
He sent his grace weekly intelligence of what passed in the
university[CB]. Sir William Davenant (poet laureat) told me that
notwithstanding this doctor's great reason, he was guiltie of the
detestable crime of treachery. Dr. Gill[CC], filius Dʳⁱˢ Gill
(schoolmaster of Paules schoole), and Chillingworth held weekely
intelligence one with another for some yeares, wherein they used to
nibble at states-matters. Dr. Gill in one of his letters calles King
James and his sonne, the old foole and the young one, which letter
Chillingworth communicates to W. Laud, A. B. Cant. The poore young Dr.
Gill was seised, and a terrible storme pointed towards him, which, by
the eloquent intercession and advocation of Edward, earle of Dorset,
together with the teares of the poore old Doctor his father, and
supplication on his knees to his majestie, were blowne-over. I am sorry
so great a witt should have such a naeve.

                  Absentem qui rodit amicum,
    Qui non defendit alio culpante, solutos
    Qui captat risus hominum famamque dicacis,
    Fingere qui non visa potest, commissa tacere
    Qui nequit: hic niger est; hunc tu, Romane, caveto.

                                        HORAT. lib. I, sat. iv.

He was a little man, blackish haire, of a saturnine complexion.

The lord Falkland (vide <life of> lord Falkland) and he had such
extraordinary clear reasons, that they were wont to say at Oxon that if
the great Turke were to be converted by naturall reason, these two were
the persons to convert him.

He lies buried in the south side of the cloysters at Chichester,
where he dyed of the _morbus castrensis_ after the taking of Arundel
castle by the parliament: wherin he was very much blamed by the king's
soldiers for his advice in military affaires there, and they curst
_that little priest_ and imputed the losse of the castle to his advice.
In his sicknesse he was inhumanely treated by Dr. Cheynell[CD], who,
when he was to be buryed, threw his booke into the grave with him,
saying, 'Rott with the rotten; let the dead bury the dead.' Vide a
pamphlet of about 6 sheets writt by Dr. Cheynell (maliciously enough)
where he gives an account of his life.

This following inscription was made and set-up by Mr. Oliver
Whitby[CE], his fellowe-collegiate at Trinity College and now one of
the prebendarys of this church:

                            Virtuti sacrum.
                    Spe certissimae resurrectionis

                          Ab OLIVERO WHITBY,
                         Brevi hoc monimento,
                   Posterorum memoriae consecratus,
                             Anno Salutis,
                              1672.[646]

[XLIV.] This is a mistake; he was not Chantor of the Church, but
Chancellor of the Church of Sarum, whose office was antiently to read
a lecture in Latin, quarterly, in the pulpit in the library, either in
Theologie or the Canon Lawe. Since the Reformation 'twas commuted into
preaching on the Holy-dayes. He never swore to all the points of the
Church of England.

[XLV.] Minister of Petworth.

My tutor, W. Browne[CF], haz told me, that Dr. Chillingworth studied
not much, but when he did, he did much in a little time. He much
delighted in Sextus Empeiricus. He did walke much in the College grove,
and there contemplate, and meet with some _cod's-head_ or other, and
dispute with him and baffle him. He thus prepared himselfe before-hand.
He would alwayes be disputing; so would my tutor. I thinke it was
an epidemick evill of that time, which I think now is growne out of
fashion, as unmannerly and boyish. He was the readiest and nimblest
disputant of his time in the university, perhaps none haz equalled him
since.

I have heard Mr. Thomas Hobbes, Malmesb. (who knew him), say, _that he
was like a lusty fighting fellow that did drive his enimies before him,
but would often give his owne party smart[647] back-blowes_.

When Doctor Kettle, (the president of Trin. Coll. Oxon.) dyed[CG],
which was in anno <1643> Dr. Chillingworth was competitor for the
presidentship, with Dr. Hannibal Potter and Dr. Roberts. Dr. Han.
Potter had been formerly chaplain to the bishop of Winton, who was so
much Dr. Potter's friend, that though (as Will Hawes haz told me) Dr.
Potter was not lawfully elected, upon referring themselves to their
visitor (bishop of Winton), the bishop (Curle) ordered Dr. Potter
possession; and let the fellowes gett him out if they could. This was
shortly after the lord Falkland was slaine, who had he lived, Dr.
Chillingworth assured Will Hawes, no man should have carried it against
him: and that he was so extremely discomposed and wept bitterly for the
losse of his deare friend, yet notwithstanding he doubted not to have
an astergance[CH] for it.


_Notes._

[CA] William Chillingworth was elected Scholar of Trinity June 2, 1618
(then of St. Martin's parish, Oxon, aged 19), and Fellow, June 10, 1628.

[CB] For another instance of reports sent to Laud (who was Chancellor
of Oxford 1630-41) about Oxford matters, see Clark's Wood's _Life and
Times_, ii. 238.

[CC] Alexander Gill matr. at Trinity College, June 26, 1612, was Clerk
at Wadham College, April 20, 1613, but rejoined Trinity and from thence
took his D.D., March 9, 1636/7. He was usher to his father in St.
Paul's School 1621-28, being removed for the offence here related.

[CD] Francis Cheynell, a native of Oxford (like Chillingworth), Fellow
of Merton 1629, D.D. July 24, 1649.

[CE] Oliver Whitby, matr. at Trinity, Oct. 15, 1619; Archdeacon of
Chichester, Dec. 23, 1672.

[CF] William Browne, of Blandford St. Mary, Dorset, aged 16, elected
Scholar of Trinity May 28, 1635, M.A. March 18, 1641/2.

[CG] Anthony Wood, in a marginal note, objects--'This cannot be: Dr.
Kettle died after Chillingworth.' But Wood is wrong. Kettell died
in July 1643; Chillingworth in January, 1643/4; Potter was admitted
President August 8, 1643.

[CH] 'Astergance,' apparently an Aubrey form for 'abstergence,' i.e.
consolation. The meaning perhaps is:--although Chillingworth was
grieved for Falkland's (or Kettell's) death, he had looked for the
consolation of being promoted to the Presidentship of his College.




=John Clavell= (1601-1642).


[648]John Clavell, the famous thiefe, borne May 11, 1601, 11ʰ 30´ P.M.




=John Cleveland= (1613-1658).


[649]John Cleveland was borne at ... (quaere Mr. Nayler) in
Warwickshire. He was a fellow of St. John's Colledge in Cambridge,
where he was more taken notice of for his being an eminent disputant,
then a good poet. Being turned out of his fellowship for a malignant
he came to Oxford, where the king's army was, and was much caressed by
them. He went thence to the garrison at Newark upon Trent, where upon
some occasion of drawing of articles, or some writing, he would needs
add a short conclusion, viz. 'and hereunto we annex our lives, as a
labell to our trust.' After the king was beaten out of the field, he
came to London, and retired in Grayes Inne. He, and Sam. Butler, &c.
of Grayes Inne, had[650] a clubb every night. He was a comely plump
man, good curled haire, darke browne. Dyed of the scurvy, and lies
buried in St. Andrew's church, in Holborne, anno Domini 165. (quaere
Mr. Nayler[651], of ...).

[XLVI.]This George, earl of Cumberland, built the greatest fleet of
shipping that ever any subject did. He had a vast estate, and could
then ride in his owne lands from Yorkeshire to Westmorland. He had ...
castles.

[XLVI.] _From Elizabeth, countesse of Thanet._

The best account of his expedition with his fleet to America is to be
found in Purchas's _Pilgrim_. He tooke from the Spaniards to the value
of seaven or 8 hundred thousand poundes. When he returned with this
riche cargo (the richest without doubt that ever subject brought), the
queene's councell (where he had some that envyed him--

                       _Virtutis comes Invidia_)

layed their heads together and concluded 'twas too much for a subject
to have, and confiscated it all to the queen, even shippes and all,
and to make restauration to the Spaniard, that he was forced to sell
fifteene thousand pounds per annum. My lady Thanet told me she sawe the
accounts in writing. The armada of the Argonautes was but a trifle to
this.

As I take it, Sir Walter Ralegh went this brave voyage with his
lordship; and Mr. Edmund Wright, the excellent navigator; and, not
unlikely, Mr. Harriot too.

This was the breaking of that ancient and noble family; but Robert,
earl of Salisbury (who was the chiefest enemie) afterwards maried his
daughter, as above, as he might well be touch't in conscience, to make
some recompence after he had donne so much mischiefe.

That he was an acquaintance of Sir Walter Raleigh, I remember by this

with Sir Walter Raleigh from Bathe, and, hunting a buck in the parke

=Henry Clifford=, earl of Cumberland (1591-1643).

[654]From the pedigree of the earles of Cumberland[CI] in the hands of
Elizabeth, countesse of Thanet, daughter of the earle of Burlington and
Corke.

George, <third> earl of Cumberland, had seaven[XLVII.] castles in the
north. He was buryed with his ancestors at Skippon Castle. Obiit about
the beginning of King James's raigne.

[XLVII.] Quaere quot castella[655].

Vide epistle to George, earl of Cumberland, before the _History of the
Massacre_.

Henry, <fifth> earl of Cumberland, was a poet; the countesse of
Corke and Burlington haz still his verses. He was of Christ Church,
Oxon[CJ]. Nicholas, earl of Thanet, was wont to say that the mare of
Fountaines-abbey did dash, meaning that since they gott that estate
(given to the church) they did never thrive but still declined.

[657]Henry, the last earle of Cumberland, was an ingeniose gentleman
for those times and a great acquaintance of the Lord Chancellor
Bacon's; and often writt to one another, which lettres the countesse
of Corke and Burlington, my lady Thanet's mother, daughter and heir of
that family, keepes as reliques; and a poeme in English that her father
wrott upon the Psalmes and many other subjects, and very well, but the
language being now something out of fashion, like Sir Philip Sydney's,
they will not print it.


_Notes._

[CI] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'checquy or and azure, a fess
gules [Clifford],' surmounted by an earl's coronet. Anthony Wood has a
note here:--'George, earl of Cumberland, A.M. 1592: A.B. Aed. Christi,
1608, quaere'--this latter degree belongs to Henry, fifth earl.

=Sir Edward Coke= (1551/2-1633).


[658]Vide his life by ...: quaere his nephew or sonne[659] Roger Coke.
Sir Edward Coke[CK], knight, Lord Chiefe Justice of the King's Bench,
was borne at ... in Norfolke. I heard an old lawyer ( ... Dunstable) of
the Middle Temple, 1646, who was his country-man, say that he was borne
to 300 _li._ land per annum[CL], and I have heard some of his country
say again that he was borne but to 40 _li._ per annum. What shall one
beleeve?

Quaere Roger Coke of what house he was in Cambridge, or if ever at the
University.

Old John Tussell (that was my attorney) haz told me that he gott a
hundred thousand pounds in one yeare, viz. 1º Jacobi, being then
attorney-generall. His advice was that every man of estate (right or
wrong) should sue-out his pardon, which cost 5 _li._ which[660] was his
fee.

He left an estate of eleaven thousand pounds per annum. Sir John
Danvers[CM], who knew him, told me that when one told him his sonnes
would spend the estate faster then he gott it, he replyed 'they cannot
take more delight in spending of it then I did in the getting of it.'

He was chamber-fellow to the Lord Chiefe Baron Wyld's father (Serjeant
Wyld[CN]). He built the black buildings at the Inner Temple (now
burn't) which were above the walke toward the west end, called then
'Coke's buildings.'

After he was putt out of his place of Lord Chief Justice of the King's
Bench[661], to spite him, they made him sheriff of Buckinghamshire,
anno Dni ...; at which time he caused the sheriff's oath to be altered,
which till that time was, amongst other things, to enquire after and
apprehend all Lollards. He was also chosen, after he was displaced, a
burghesse to sitt in Parliament.

[XLVIII.]He was of wonderfull painstaking, as appeares by his writings.
He was short-sighted but never used spectacles to his dyeing day,
being then 83 yeares of age. He was a very handsome proper man and
of a curious complexion, as appeares by his picture at the Inner
Temple, which his grandson gave them about 1668, at length, in his
atturney-generall's fusted gowne, which the house haz turned into
judge's robes.

[XLVIII.] From Roger Coke.

He maried, his second wife, ..., the relickt of Sir ... Hatton, who was
with child when he maried her[662].--<from> <Elizabeth> lady Purbec;
vide B. Johnson's masque of the Gipsies.

He dyed at Stoke-poges in com. Bucks ... 1638[663] (quaere), but is
buryed at ... in Norfolk.

For his moralls, see _Sir W. Raleigh's Tryall_.

He shewed himselfe too clownish and bitter in his carriage to Sir
Walter Ralegh at his triall, where he sayes 'Thou traytor,' at every
word, and 'thou lyest like a traytor.' See it in Sir Walter Ralegh's
life, Lond. 1678, 8vo.

His rule:--

    Sex horas somno, totidem des legibus aequis,
      Quatuor orabis, des epulisque duas,
    Quod reliquum est tempus sacris largire Camenis.

He playes[664] with his case as a cat would with a mouse, and be so
fulsomely pedantique that a school boy would nauseate it. But when he
comes to matter of lawe, all acknowledge him to be admirable. When Mr.
Cuff[665], secretary to the earle of Essex, was arraigned, he would
dispute with him in syllogismes, till at last one of his brethern said,
'Prithee, brother, leave off: thou doest dispute scurvily.' Cuff was a
smart man and a great scholar and baffeld him. Said Cooke

                     'Dominum cognoscite vestrum';

Cuff replied,'My lord, you leave out the former part of the verse[666],
which you should have repeated,

                          _Acteon_ ego sum'--

reflecting on his being a cuckold.

[667]The world expected from him a commentary on Littleton's Tenures;
and he left them his Common-place book, which is now so much made use
of.

Sir Edward Coke did envie[668] Sir Francis Bacon, and was wont to
undervalue his lawe: vide de hoc in the lord Bacon's lettres, where he
expostulates this thing with Sir Edward Coke, and tells him that he may
grow when that others doe stand at a stay.

Memorandum:--he was of Clifford's Inne before he was of the Inner
Temple, as the fashion then was first to be of an Inne of Chancery.

Memorandum:--when the play called _Ignoramus_ (made by one Ruggle of
Clare-hall) was acted with great applause before King James, they
dressed Sir Ignoramus like Chief Justice Coke and cutt his beard like
him and feigned his voyce. Mr. Peyton, our vicar of Chalke, was then a
scholar at Kings College and sawe it. This drollery did ducere in seria
mala: it sett all the lawyers against the clergie, and shortly upon
this Mr. Selden wrote of Tythes not jure divino.


_Notes._

[CK] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'..., 3 eagles displayed ...'

[CL] In MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 97ᵛ, Aubrey has this note:--'Sir Edward Coke,
Lord Chief Justice--when I was first of the Middle Temple, I heard an
old (80 <years old>) Norfolke gentleman of the <name of> Dunstable
affirme that Sir Edward Coke was borne but to 300 _li._ a yeare land.'

[CM] This story is repeated at the foot of the leaf:--'Sir John Danvers
told me that he had heard one say to him, reflecting on his great
scraping of wealth, that his sonnes would spend his estate faster then
he gott it. He replied, they cannot take more delight in the spending
of it then I did in the getting of it.'

Chief Baron of the Exchequer, 1648.




=Jean Baptiste Colbert= (1619-1683).


[669]Monsieur ... Colbert was a merchant and an excellent accomptant,
i.e. for Debtor and Creditor. He is of Scotish extraction and that
obscure enough, his grandfather being a Scotish bag-piper to the Scotch
regiment.

Cardinal Mezarin found that his stables were very chardgeable to him,
and was imposed upon in accompts. He hearing of this merchant Colbert
to be a great master in this art, sends for him and desires him to make
inspection into his accounts and putt him into a better method to avoyd
being abused. Which he did, and that so well that he imployed him in
ordering the accounts of all his estate and found him so usefull that
he also made use of him to methodize and settle the accompts of the
king. This was his rise.--From Dr. John Pell.




=John Colet= (1466-1519).


[670]John Colet, D.D., deane of St. Paule's, London--vide Sir William
Dugdale's Historie of Paule's church. After the conflagration his
monument being broken, his coffin, which was lead, was full of a
liquour which conserved the body. Mr. Wyld and Ralph Greatorex tasted
it and 'twas of a kind of insipid tast, something of an ironish tast.
The body felt, to the probe of a stick which they thrust into a chinke,
like brawne. The coffin was of lead and layd in the wall about 2 foot
1/2 above the surface of the floore.




=Henry Coley= (1633-1695?).


[671]My friend Mr. Henry Coley was borne in Magdalen parish in the city
of Oxon, Octob. 18, 1633. His father was a joyner over against the
Theater.

He is a tayler in Graies Inne lane.

He hath published an ingeniose discourse called _Clavis Astrologiae_,
in English, 1669.

He is a man of admirable parts, and more to be expected from him every
day: and as good a natured man as can be. And comes by his learning
meerly by the strong impulse of his genius. He understands Latin and
French: yet never learned out his grammar.

[672]Henry Coley[CO] natus Oxon, neer Kettle-hall, Octob. 18, horâ 2.
15´ 4˝ P.M.--his father a joyner.

He was a woman's tayler: tooke to the love of astrologie, in which he
grew in a short time a good proficient; and in Mr. W. Lilly's later
time, when his sight grew dimme, was his amanuensis.

He hath great practise in astrologie, and teacheth mathematiques. He
hath published _Clavis Astrologiae_, 1675, a thick octavo, the second
edition, wherein he has compiled clearly the whole science out of the
best authors.


_Note._

[CO] Aubrey gives 'ab Astronomiâ Britannicâ,' Coley's nativity and the
'latitudo planetarum' at his birth, on the scheme

'Henry Coley, astrologer, born at Oxon, 1633, October 18, 2ʰ 15´ 4˝
P.M., latit. 51° 42´.'




=John Collins= (1624/5-1683).


[673]John Collins, accomptant, was borne at Wood-eaton neer Oxford,
March the 5th, 1624/5, about half an houre after 5 at night (Saturday
night): this I had from himselfe.

[674]John Collins obiit London, November 10, 1683.

[675]John Collins:--adde his sheet _Of interest_, and _Plea for Irish
cattle_: all the rest are set downe, but not when printed. And also his
_Historie of salt and fisherie_[676], 1682, printed by A. Godbid, 4to.

Society: scripsit plurima: he was not an University man, but was first
prentice to <Thomas> Allam the booke-binder.

=Thomas Cooper= (1517?-1594).


[680]Thomas Cooper, Magdalenensis--vide Anthony Wood's _Antiq. Oxon._:
quaere if he was not schoolmaster at Winchester Colledge?

Dr. Edward Davenant told me that this learned man had a shrew to his
wife, who was irreconcileably angrie with him for sitting-up late at
night so, compileing[681] his Dictionarie, (_Thesaurus linguae Romanae
et Britannicae_, Londini, 1584; dedicated to Robert Dudley, earl of
Leicester, and Chancellor of Oxford). When he had halfe-donne it, she
had the opportunity to gett into his studie, tooke all his paines
out in her lap, and threw it into the fire, and burnt it. Well, for
all that, that good man had so great a zeale for the advancement of
learning, that he began it again, and went through with it to that
perfection that he hath left it to us, a most usefull worke. He was
afterwards made bishop of Winton.

He dyed <29 Apr. 1594>.


_In Thesaurum Thomae Cooper, Magdalenensis, hexasticon Richardi
Stephani._

    Vilescat rutila dives Pactolus arena,
      Hermus, et auriferi nobilis unda Tagi,
    Vilescant Croesi gemmae Midaeque talenta,
      Major apud Britones[XLIX.] eruta gaza patet:
    Hoc, Wainflete, tuo gens Anglica debet alumno,
      Qui vigili nobis tanta labore dedit.

[XLIX.] Verstegan deservedly blames him for that expression.

[682]Mr. Pulleyn[683] tells me that Cowper who wrot the Dictionary was
not bishop of Winton but of Lincoln: vide and mend it[684].




=Richard Corbet= (1583-1635).


[685]Epitaph on master Vincent Corbet, gardiner, father of the bishop:
B. J<onson's> _Underwoods_, p. 177.

[686]Richard Corbet, episcopus (ex last edition of his poemes, in
preface sc. p. 16) was made deane of Christ Church, 1620; bishop of
Oxon, 1628; bishop of Norwich, 1632. Vide Anthony Wood's _Antiq. Oxon._

[687]Richard Corbet[CP], D.D., was the son of Vincent Corbet--vide his
poem--

              'better[688] known
    By Poynter's name then by his owne
    Here lies engaged till the day
    Of raysing bones and quickning clay:
    No wonder, reader, that he hath
    Two sirnames in one epitaph,
    For this one doth comprehend
    All that both families could lend--

who was a gardner at Twicknam, as I have heard my old cosen Whitney
say. Vide in B. Johnson's _Underwoods_ an epitaph on this Vincent
Corbet, where he speakes of his nurseries etc., p. 177.

He was a Westminster scholar; old parson Bussey, of Alscott in
Warwickshire, went to schoole with him--he would say that he was a very
handsome man, but something apt to abuse, and a coward.

He was a student (vide Anthony Wood's _Antiq. Oxon._) of Christ-church
in Oxford. He was very facetious, and a good fellowe. One time he and
some of his acquaintance being merry at Fryar Bacon's study (where
was good liquor sold), they were drinking on the leads of the house,
and one of the scholars was asleepe, and had a paire of good silke
stockings on. Dr. Corbet (then M.A., if not B.D.) gott a paire of
cizers and cutt them full of little holes, but when the other awaked,
and percieved how and by whom he was abused, he did chastise him, and
made him pay for them.

After he was D. of Divinity, he sang ballads at the Crosse at Abingdon
on a market-day. He and some of his camerades were at the taverne by
the crosse,[L.] (which by the way was then the finest of England; I
remember it when I was a freshman: it was admirable curious Gothique
architecture, and fine figures in the niches: 'twas one of those
built by king ... for his queen: vide Chronicle). The ballad singer
complaynd, he had no custome, he could not putt-off his ballades. The
jolly Doctor putts-off his gowne, and putts-on the ballad singer's
leathern jacket, and being a handsome man, and had a rare full voice,
he presently vended a great many, and had a great audience.

[L.] 'Twas after the fashion of the crosse in High-street in Bristowe,
but more curious worke. Quaere if not marble?

After the death of Dr. <William Goodwyn>, he was made deane of
Christ-church (quaere if ever canon); vide[689] part iii, pag. 7b.

He had a good interest with great men, as you may find in his poems,
and with the then great favourite, the duke of Bucks; his excellent
witt was lettres of recommendation to him. I have forgott the story,
but at the same time that Dr. <Samuel> Fell thought to have carried it,
Dr. Corbet putt a pretty trick on <him> to lett him take a journey on
purpose to London for it, when he had already the graunt of it.

He preacht a sermon before the king at Woodstock (I suppose king James,
quaere) and no doubt with a very good grace; but it happened that he
was out, on which occasion there were made these verses:--

    A reverend deane,
    With his band[690] starch't cleane,
      Did preach before the King;
    In his band string was spied
    A ring that was tied[CQ],
      Was not that a pretty thing?
    If then without doubt,
    In his text he was out
    . . . . . . next,
    The ring without doubt
    Was the thing putt him out,
    For all that were there,
    On my conscience, dare sweare,
      That he handled it more than his text:--

vide the verses.

[691]His conversation[692] was extreme pleasant. Dr. Stubbins[CR]
was one of his cronies; he was a jolly fatt Dr. and a very good
house-keeper; parson of <Ambrosden> in Oxfordshire. As Dr. Corbet and
he were riding in Lob-lane, in wett weather, ('tis an extraordinary
deepe dirty lane) the coach fell; and Dr. Corbet sayd that Dr. Stubbins
was up to the elbowes in mud, he was up to the elbowes in Stubbins.

Anno Domini <1628> he was made bishop of Oxford, and I have heard that
he had an admirable, grave, and venerable aspect.

One time, as he was confirming, the country people pressing in to
see[693] the ceremonie, sayd he, '_Beare-off there, or I'le confirme
yee with my staffe_.' Another time being to lay his hand on the head
of a man very bald, he turns to his chaplaine (Lushington) and sayd,
'_Some dust, Lushington_,' (to keepe his hand from slipping). There was
a man with a great venerable beard; sayd the bishop, '_You, behind the
beard_.'

His chaplain, Dr. Lushington[CS], was a very learned and ingeniose
man, and they loved one another. The bishop sometimes would take the
key of the wine-cellar, and he and his chaplaine would goe and lock
themselves in and be merry. Then first he layes downe his episcopall
hat,--'_There lyes the Dr._' Then he putts of his gowne,--'_There lyes
the Bishop_.' Then 'twas,--'_Here's to thee, Corbet_,' and '_Here's to
thee, Lushington_.'--From Josias Howe, B.D., Trin. Coll. Oxon.

He built a pretty house (quaere) neer the cawsey beyond Friar Bacon's
studie.

He married[CT] ..., whom 'twas sayd he begott. She was a very
beautifull woman, and so was her mother. He had a son (I think Vincent)
that went to schoole at Westminster, with Ned Bagshawe; a very handsome
youth, but he is run out of all, and goes begging up and downe to
gentlemen.

He was made bishop of Norwich, Anno Domini <1632>. He dyed <28 July,
1635>. The last words he sayd were, '_Good night, Lushington_.' He lyes
buried in the upper end of the choire at Norwich, [on the south side of
the monument of bishop Herbert, the founder, under a faire gravestone
of free-stone, from whence the inscription[CU] and scutcheon of brasse
are stollen[694]].

His poems are pure naturall witt, delightfull and easie.

Quaere what he hath writt besides his poems: vide part iii, p.[695] 7b.

It appeares by his verses to Master Ailesbury[CV], Dec. 9, 1618, that
he had knowledge of analyticall learning, being so well acquainted with
him and the learned Mr. Thomas Harriot.

[696]I have not seen the date of his _Iter Boreale_; but it ends thus:--

    We return'd, but just with so much ore,
    As Rauleigh from his voyage, and no more.

[697]Memorandum:--his antagonist Dr. <Daniel> Price, the anniversarist,
was made deane of the church at Hereford. Dr. <William> Watts, canon of
that church, told me, 1656, that this deane was a mighty pontificall
proud man, and that one time when they went in procession about the
cathedrall church, he would not doe it the usually way in his surplice,
hood, etc., on foot, but rode on a mare, thus habited, with the
Common-Prayer booke in his hand, reading. A stone-horse happend to
breake loose[698] ... he would never ride in procession afterwards.

[699]In the cathedral church of Norwich, upper end of the choeur,
towards the steppes to the altar, in the middle is a little altar-tombe
of bishop Herbert the founder; south of which tombe is a faire
freestone gravestone of bishop Corbet, the inscription and shield of
brasse are stollen. Vide A. Wood's _Antiq. Oxon._ <His> son <is a>
fainiant.

house at Shirburne in Dorsetshire; her name was Gertrude.

This was when Sherburne castle was besieged, and when the fight was
at Babell hills, between Sherburn and Yeovill: the first fight in the
civill warres that was considerable. But the first _brush_ was between
the earle of Northampton (father to Henry, the lord bishop of London)
and the lord Brooke, neer Banbury: which was the later end of July, or
the beginning of August, 1642. I[701] was sent for into the countrey
to my great griefe, and departed the 9th of Aug. 'Twas before I went
away, I beleeve in Aug. Quaere de hoc.

But to returne to T. Coryat: had he lived to returne into England, his
travells had been most estimable, for though he was not a wise man, he
wrote faithfully matter of fact.




=Abraham Cowley= (1618-1667).


[702]Mr. Abraham Cowley[CW]: he was borne in Fleet-street, London, neer
Chancery-lane; his father a grocer, at the signe of....

He was secretarie to the earle of St. Alban's (then lord Jermyn) at
Paris. When his majestie returned, the duke of Buckingham hearing
that at Chertsey was a good farme of about ... _li._ per annum,
belonging to the queene-mother, goes to the earl of St. Alban's and
the commissioners to[703] take a lease of it. They answered that 'twas
beneath his grace to take a lease of them. That was all one, he would
have it, payd for it, and had it, and freely and generously gave it to
his deare and ingeniose friend, Mr. Abraham Cowley, for whom purposely
he bought it.

He lies interred at Westminster Abbey, next to Sir Jeffrey Chaucer, N.,
where the duke of Bucks has putt a neate monument of white marble, viz.
a faire pedestall, wheron the inscription:--

                   Abrahamus Couleius,
            Anglorum Pindarus, Flaccus, Maro,
          Deliciae, Decus, Desiderium aevi sui,
                  Hic juxta situs est.

    Aurea dum volitant latè tua scripta per orbem,
    Et famâ aeternùm vivis, divine Poeta,
    Hic placidâ jaceas requie; custodiat urnam
    Cana Fides, vigilentque perenni lampade Musae;
    Sit sacer iste locus. Nec quis temerarius ausit
    Sacrilegâ turbare manu venerabile bustum.
    Intacti maneant, maneant per secula, dulcis
    Coulei cineres serventque immobile saxum.

                               Sic vovet,

    Votumque suum apud posteros sacratum esse voluit, qui
    viro incomparabili posuit sepulcrale marmor, GEORGIUS dux
    BUCKINGHAMIAE.

    Abraham Cowley excessit e vitâ anno aetatis suae 49; et,
    honorificâ pompâ elatus ex Aedibus Buckinghamianis, viris[LI.]
    illustribus omnium ordinum exequias celebrantibus, sepultus est
    die 3 mensis Augusti anno Domini 1667.

[LI.] His grace the duke of Bucks held a tassell of the pall.

Above that a very faire urne, with a kind of ghirland of ivy about it.

The inscription was made by Dr. <Thomas> Spratt, his grace's
chapellane: the Latin verses were made, or mended, by Dr. <Thomas> Gale.

On his very noble gravestone, his scutcheon, and

                          Abrahamus Couleius
                               H. S. E.
                                 1667.

Memorandum:--this George, duke of Bucks, came to the earl of St. Albans
and told him he would buy such a lease in Chertsey belonging to the
queen mother. Said the earle to him, 'that is beneath your grace, to
take a lease.' 'That is all one,' qd. he, 'I desire to have the favour
to buy it for my money.' He bought it, and then freely bestowed it on
his beloved Cowley: which ought not to be forgotten.

By Sir J. Denham:--

    Had Cowley ne're spoke, nor Th.[704] Killigrew writt,
    They'd both have made a <very> good witt.

--A. C. discoursed very ill and with hesitation.

He writ when a boy at Westminster ... poems and a comedy called _Love's
Riddle_, dedicated to Sir Kenelme Digby; printed, London, ..., 8vo.

[705]Abraham Cowley:--vide his will, scilicet, for his true and lasting
charity, that is, he settles his estate in such a manner that every
yeare so much is to be payd for the enlarging of poor prisoners cast
into gaole by cruel creditors for some debt. This I had from Mr.
Dunning of London, a scrivener, who is an acquaintance of Dr. Cowley's
brother. I doe thinke this memorable benefaction is not mentioned
in his life in print before his workes; and it is certainly the best
method of charity.


_Note._

[CW] Aubrey notes that he was of 'Cambridge,' and gives in trick the
coat:--'..., a lion rampant ..., within a bordure engrailed ...,'
wreathed in laurel.




=... Cradock.=


[706]Memorandum:--Mris Smyth[707] told me of one ... Cradock in the
west (where Mris Smyth's relations or birth) from a cratch dyed worth
10,000 _li._--Quaere de hoc, e.g. <at> Taunton or Warminster.




=William Croone= (1633-1684).


[708]... Croun, M.D., obiit Sunday Oct. 12, 1684, London; buried at St.
Mildred's in the Poultry. His funerall sermon is printed. He was fellow
of the Physitians' College and also Regiae Societatis Socius.




=... Curtin.=


[709]Madam Curtin, a good fortune of 3000 _li._, daughter to Sir
William Curtin, the great merchant, lately married her footman, who,
not long after marriage, beates her, getts her money, and ran away.




=Robert Dalzell=, earl of Carnwarth (15..-1654).


[710]'Twas the lord Kenwurth that sayd to the earl of Salisbury _Ken
you an ape, sir_,--from Elizabeth, countesse of Thanet.


_Note._

The Rev. H. E. D. Blakiston, of Trinity College, suggested to me the
transliteration of 'Kenwurth' to 'Carnwarth.' Robert Dalzell succeeded
as second earl of Carnwath in 1639, died 1654. He might be in conflict
about Scotch matters with William Cecil, second earl of Salisbury,
commissioner to treat with the Scots at Ripon, in 1640.




=Sir Charles Danvers= (1568-1600/1).


[711]Sir Charles Danvers was beheaded on Tower-hill with Robert, earle
of Essex, February the 6th, 1600[712]. I find in the register of
the Tower chapell only the sepulture of Robert, earl of Essex, that
yeare; wherfore I am induced to beleeve that his body was carryed
to Dantesey[CX] in Wilts to lye with his ancestors. Vide Stowe's
Chronicle, where is a full account of his and the earle's deportment at
their death on the scaffold.

With all their faylings, Wilts cannot shew two such[713] brothers.

His familiar acquaintance were ...[714], earl of Oxon; Sir Francis and
Sir Horace Vere; Sir Walter Ralegh, etc.--the heroes of those times.

Quaere my lady viscountesse Purbec and also the lord Norris for an
account of the behaviour and advice of Sir Charles Danvers in the
businesse of the earl of Essex, which advice had the earle followed he
had saved his life.

[715]Of Sir Charles Danvers, from my lady viscountesse Purbec:--Sir
Charles Danvers advised the earle of Essex, either to treat with the
queen--hostages ..., whom Sir Ferdinando Gorges did let goe; or to
make his way through the gate at Essex house, and then to hast away to
Highgate, and so to Northumberland (the earl of Northumberland maried
his mother's sister), and from thence to the king of Scots, and there
they might make their peace; if not, the queen was old and could not
live long. But the earle followed not his advice, and so they both lost
their heads on Tower-hill.


_Note._

[CX] In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 46, Aubrey writes, in reference to burials at
Dantesey, 'quaere, if Sir Charles Danvers that was beheaded?--He was
buryed in the Tower chapell.' Aubrey's description of the burial-place
of the Danvers family (MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 46), with the inscriptions,
is printed in J. E. Jackson's Aubrey's _Wiltshire Collections_, pp.
223-225; the pedigree of Danvers is there given at p. 216.




=Elizabeth Danvers.=


[716]His[CY] mother, an Italian, prodigious parts for a woman. I have
heard my father's mother say that she had Chaucer at her fingers' ends.

A great politician; great witt and spirit, but revengefull[717].

Knew how to manage her estate as well as any man; understood jewells as
well as any jeweller.

Very beautifull, but only short-sighted. To obtain pardons for her
sonnes[718] she maryed Sir Edmund Carey, cosen-german to queen
Elizabeth, but kept him to hard meate.

Smyth of Smythcotes--Naboth's vineyard--digitus Dei[CZ].

The _arcanum_--'traditio lampadis' in the family of Latimer[DA] of
poysoning king Henry 8--from my lady Purbec.


_Notes._

[CY] i.e. Henry, earl of Danby's. She was Elizabeth, daughter of John
Nevill, the last lord Latimer. 'An Italian' may mean that she knew that
language, among her other accomplishments. I can make nothing of a note
added by Aubrey here, which seems to read '... Cowley, crop-ear'd.'

[CZ] I do not know to what circumstance, in the history of the Danvers
family, Aubrey here applies 1 Kings xxi. 19.

[DA] Catherine Parr, last consort of Henry VIII, was widow of John, 3rd
lord Latimer; and step-mother of John, 4th lord Latimer, the father of
this Elizabeth Danvers, whose grand-daughter ('viscountess Purbeck')
was Aubrey's informant.




=Henry Danvers=, earl of Danby (1573-1644).


[719]Henry Danvers[DB], earl of Danby; vide his christning and
epitaph in libro[DC] A. in Dantesey church: vide <David> Lloyd's
_State-worthies_, 8vo, 1679.

Quaere my brother William, and J. Stokes, for the examination order of
the murther[DD] at Cosham in North Wilts. Old L. Shippon, Oxon,

                      'From Turke and Pope,' etc.

R. Wisdome was then lecturer and preacht that day, and Henry Long
expired[720] in his armes. My great-grandfather, R. Danvers, was in
some trouble about it, his horses and men being in that action. His
servants were hanged and so ... Long of Linets. Vide Degory Wheare's
Epistles and John Owen's Epigrams.

Physick Garden <at Oxford>: inscriptions there; inscription at Dantesey.

<He> gave to Sir Thomas Overbury _cloath_.

<He> perfected his Latin when a man by parson Oldham of Dodmerton.
<He was a> perfect master of the French; a historian; tall and spare;
temperate; sedate and solid; a very great favorite of prince Henry;
lived most at Cornbury; a great improver of his estate, to 11000 _li._
per annum at the least; sold the 7 Downes, and turned the[721] ⓐ into
lease; afterwards bought fee-simple neer Cirencester.

[722]Henry, earl of Danby, <was a> great oeconomist. All his servants
<were> sober and wise[723] in their respective places. <He> kept ...
gentlemen: <among them> colonel Legge[724] (governor of Portsmouth);
and his brother; Mr. Arthur Drake (brother of Sir ... Drake, baronet).

[725]Earl of Danby--he was page to Sir Philip Sydney--from my cozen
Elizabeth Villers: quaere +.

[726]Memorandum:--anno Domini, 16--, regno regis Caroli primi, Henry,
earle of Danby, built an almeshowse in this parish <Dantesey, co.
Wilts> for <six> poore people and[727] a schoole--quaere the salary[DE]
of both.


_Notes._

[DB] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'<gules>, a chevron between
3 mullets <or> [Danby]; quartering, <gules>, a saltire engrailed
<argent>, an annulet for difference [Nevill, lord Latimer],' surmounted
by an earl's coronet.

[DC] i.e. in MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 46: see _supra_, p. 192. The epitaph
contains English verses by George Herbert.

[DD] Henry, brother of Sir Robert, Long was killed, possibly in
fair fight, by Sir Charles, brother of this Henry, Danvers: see the
_Archaeological Magazine_, i. 306. In consequence, the Danvers brothers
had to seek safety in France. In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 44ᵛ, Aubrey notes
'Sommerford magna--the assassination of Harry Long was contrived in
the parlour of the parsonage here. Mr. Atwood was then parson; he was
drown'd comeing home.'

Richard Atwood, M.A. Oxon, 1576: another instance of 'Digitus Dei.'

[DE] See Jackson's Aubrey's _Wiltshire Collections_, p. 228.




=Sir John Danvers= (15..-1594).


[728]Sir John Danvers, the father, <was> a most beautifull and good
and even-tempered person. His picture <is> yet extant--my cosen John
Danvers (his son[729]) haz it at ... Memorandum, George Herbert's
verses on the curtaine.

He was of a mild and peaceable nature, and his sonnes' sad
accident[730] brake his heart.

[731]By the same[732] (orator of the University of Cambridge), pinned
on the curtaine of the picture of old Sir John Danvers, who was both a
handsome and a good man:--

    Passe not by: search and you may
    Find a treasure worth your stay.
    What makes a Danvers would you find?
    In a faire bodie, a faire mind.
    Sir John Danvers' earthly part
    Here is copyed out by art:
    But his heavenly and divine
    In his progenie doth shine.
    Had he only brought them forth,
    Know that much had been his worth.
    Ther's no monument to a sonne:
    Reade him there[733], and I have donne.




=Sir John Danvers= (1588?-1655).


[734]Sir John Danvers:--His first wife was the lady <Magdalen> Herbert,
a widowe, mother of the lord Edward Herbert of Cherbery and George
Herbert, orator. By her he had no issue; she was old enough to have
been his mother. He maried her for love of her witt. The earl of
Danby[735] was greatly displeased with him for this dis-agreable match.

[736]Sir John, his sonne, was then[737] a child about six. An ingeniose
person, e.g. Chelsey house and garden, and Lavington garden[738].
A great friend of the king's partie and a patron to distressed and
cashiered cavaliers, e.g. captain Gunter, he served; Christopher
Gibbons (organist); captain Peters, etc.--Lord Bacon's friend. But
to revenge himselfe of his sister, the l<ady> Garg<rave> to[739]
ingratiate himself more with the P<rotector> to null his brother, earl
of Danby's, will, he, contrary to his owne naturall inclination, did
sitt in the high court of justice at the king's triall.

Dantesey (2500 _li._ per annum), not entailed, <was> forfeited and
given to the duke of Yorke.

His son, John, by his last wife (<Grace> Hughes), has 500 _li._ per
annum (old land) in Oxonshire, which was part of judge[740] Danvers'
estate tempore Edwardi IV, one of the judges with Litleton.

Henry, the eldest son of Sir John Danvers, dyed before his father,
and left his two sisters co-heires, viz. Elizabeth[741] <who> married
Robert Viliers (only son of viscount Purbec), and Anne, married to Sir
<Henry> Lee of Ditchley.




=The Danvers-Villiers family.=


    <MS. Aubr. 21, fol. 97, gives 'eight coelestiall schemes[DF],
    being the nativities of Robert Danvers, esq. (that is, Robert
    Villers, son of the viscount Purbec[DG]), the lady Elizabeth
    his wife, and their six children, vidᵗ. foure daughters and two
    sonnes, diligently calculated according to art by the Tables
    of Regiomontanus by W. C.' This paper supplies the following
    dates:-->

<Ask Elizabeth, viscountess Purbec> the year and day when her son, the
lord Purbec, was killed in a duel at Liege? Respondet: he was killed in
a duell at Liege about a year before the death of King Charles IIᵈ--I
thinke in the month of Aprill.


_Notes._

[DF] In MS. Aubr. 21, fol. 97ᵛ, is a note:--'These,' I suppose the
schemes given on the recto of the leaf, 'were done when he,' Robert
Danvers, 'was in Caersbrooke Castle, prisoner, in the Isle of Wight.'

[DG] In MS. Aubr. 23, on a slip at fol. 121ᵛ, is the note:--'Lord ...
Purbec,' i.e. John Villiers, created viscount Purbeck in 1619, 'natus
at Godbee, Sept. 6, 12ʰ P.M., 1591: melancholy. His mother saith he was
borne Sept. 6, Monday, 12ʰ P.M., 1591. Mris Toman writeth that it was
2ʰ 30´ P.M.'

[DH] Robert Wright (took the name of Danvers), son of Frances (daughter
of Sir Edward Coke; wife of John Villiers, of note 2) who eloped in
1621 with Sir Robert Howard. He styled himself 'viscount Purbeck'; died
1675.

[DI] Robert Fielding ('Beau' Fielding) afterwards married his widow,
Margaret, daughter of Ulick Burke, marquis of Clanricarde.




=Michael Dary= (16..-1679).


[745]Michaell Dary, mathematician, and a gunner of the Tower (by
profession, a tobacco-cutter), an admirable algebrician, was buryed
in the churchyard neer Bethlem on May-day 1679. With writing in the
frostie weather[746] his fingers rotted and gangraened. He was an old
man; I guesse about 66 +.




=Edward Davenant=, merchant (15..-16..).


[747]Edward Davenant, merchant: he lies buried behind the bishop's
stall at Sarum with this inscription[748]:--

              Literas, lyceo, rerumque usus, emporio, etc.

[749]Memorandum:--Mr. <Edward> Davenant, merchant in London, eldest
brother of John Davenant, bishop of Sarum, broke (the seas being crosse
to him); but being a person of great estimation with the merchants,
they favoured him, and he went into Ireland. He did set up the trade of
pilchard fishing at Wythy Island[750] there, where he was a Justice of
Peace, and in 20 yeares he gott there about ten thousand pounds, payd
his debts, and left his family well. This account I had from my worthy
and intimate friend, Mr. John Davenant, grandsonne to him.




=Edward Davenant=, D.D. (16..-1679/80).


[751]Edward Davenant[DJ], S. Theol. Dr., was the eldest son of <Edward>
Davenant, merchant of London, who was elder brother to the right
reverend father in God, the learned John Davenant, bishop of Sarum.

I will first speake of the father, for he was a rare[752] man
in his time, and deserves to be remembred. He was of a healthy
complexion[753], rose at 4 or 5 in the morning, so that he followed
his studies till 6 or 7, the time that other merchants goe about
their businesse; so that, stealing so much and so quiet time in the
morning, he studied as much as most men. He understood Greeke and
Latin perfectly, and was a better Grecian then the bishop. He writt a
rare Greeke character as ever I sawe. He was a great mathematician,
and understood as much of it as was knowen in his time. Dr. Davenant,
his son, hath excellent notes of his father's, in mathematiques, as
also in Greeke, and 'twas no small advantage <to> him to have such
a learned father to imbue arithmeticall knowledge into him when a
boy, night times when he came from schoole (Merchant Taylors'). He
understood trade very well, was a sober and good menager, but the
winds and seas cross'd him. He had so great losses that he broke, but
his creditors knowing it was no fault of his, and also that he was a
person of great vertue and justice, used not extremity towards him; but
I thinke gave him more credit, so that he went into Ireland, and did
sett up a fishery for pilchards at Wythy Island, in Ireland, where in
... yeares he gott 10000 _li._; satisfied and payd his creditors; and
over and above left a good estate to his son. His picture bespeakes
him to be a man of judgement, and parts, and gravity extraordinary.
There is written _Expecto_. He slipt comeing downe the stone stayres at
the palace at Sarum, which bruise caused his death. He lyes buried in
the south aissle of the choire in Sarum Cathedral behind the bishop's
stall. His son, Dr. Davenant, sett up and made this inscription for
him, which I will remember as well as I can:--

    Literas, lyceo, rerumque usus, emporio,
    Nostris edoctus, ingentis hinc prudentiae
    Extulit merces insulas ad Hibernicas;
    Ubi annos viginti custos pacis publicae
    Populum ditavit inopem, emollivit ferum,
    Gratus et charus Anglis et Hibernicis.
    Musis dilectus Latiis, nec minus Atticis,
    Studiisque fratrem, hujus ecclesiae praesulem,
    Sequebatur aemulus. Omnes in illius pectore
    Fulserunt Gratiae, sed praenituit Pietas,
    Quae in egenos tantum non fuit prodiga.
    Post varios casus, in vitae actu ultimo
    Cum luctu[754] bonorum, plausu omnium, exiit.
    Quid multis? Scias hoc, lector: vivus memoria
    Pollebat mirâ, mortuus redolet suavi.

            Obiit anno { Aetatis suae ...
                       { Aerae Christianae ...

[755]Dr. Edward Davenant was borne at his father's howse at Croydon in
Surrey (the farthest handsome great howse on the left hand as you ride
to Bansted Downes) anno Domini ... (vide register). I have heard him
say, he thankt God his father did not know the houre of his birth; for
that it would have tempted him to have studyed astrologie, for which he
had no esteeme at all.

He went to school at Merchant Taylors' school, from thence to Queen's
Colledge in Cambridge, of which house his uncle, John Davenant,
(afterwards bishop of Sarum), was head, where[756] he was fellowe.

When his uncle was preferred to the church of Sarum, he made his nephew
treasurer of the church, which is the best dignity, and gave him the
vicaridge of Gillingham in com. Dorset, and then Paulsholt parsonage,
neer the Devises, which last in the late troubles he resigned to his
wive's brother <William> Grove.

He was to his dyeing day of great diligence in study, well versed in
all kinds of learning, but his genius did most strongly encline him
to the mathematiques, wherin he has written (in a hand as legible as
print) MSS. in 4to a foot high at least. I have often heard him say
(jestingly) that he would have a man knockt in the head that should
write any thing in mathematiques that had been written of before. I
have heard Sir Christopher Wren say that he does beleeve he was the
best mathematician in the world about 30 or 35 + yeares agoe. But being
a divine he was unwilling to print, because the world should not know
how he had spent the greatest part of his time.

He very rarely went any farther then the church, which is hard by his
house. His wife was a very discreet and excellent huswife, that he
troubled himselfe about no mundane affaires, and 'tis a private place,
that he was but little diverted with visitts.

I have writt to his executor, that we may have the honour and favour to
conserve his MSS. in the Library of the Royal Societie, and to print
what is fitt. I hope I shall obtaine my desire. And the bishop of Exon
(<Thomas> Lamplugh) maried the Dr's second daughter Katherine, and
he was tutor to Sir Joseph Williamson, our President. He had a noble
library, which was the aggregate of his father's, the bishop's, and his
owne.

He was of middling stature, something spare; and weake, feeble leggs;
he had sometimes the goute; was of great temperance, he alwayes dranke
his beer at meales with a toast, winter and summer, and sayd it made
the beer the better.

He was not only a man of vast learning, but of great goodnes and
charity; the parish and all his friends will have a great losse in him.
He tooke no use for money upon bond. He was my singular good friend,
and to whom I have been more beholding then to any one beside; for I
borrowed five hundred pounds of him for a yeare and a halfe, and I
could not fasten any interest on him.

He was very ready to teach and instruct. He did[757] me the favour to
informe me first in Algebra. His daughters were Algebrists.

His most familiar learned acquaintance was Lancelot Morehouse,
parson of Pertwood. I remember when I was a young Oxford scholar,
that he could not endure to heare of the _New_ (Cartesian, or &c.)
_Philosophy_; 'for,' sayd he, 'if a new philosophy is brought-in, a new
divinity will shortly follow' (or 'come next'); and he was right.

He dyed at his house at Gillingham aforesaid, where he and his
predecessor, Dr. <John> Jessop, had been vicars one hundred and ...
yeares, and lyes buryed in the chancell there. Obiit March 9th,
1679/80, and was buried the 31 of the same month.

He was heire to his uncle, John Davenant, bishop of Sarum.
Memorandum:--when bishop Coldwell[DK] came to this bishoprick, he did
lett long leases, which were but newly expired when bishop Davenant
came to this sea; so that there tumbled into his coffers vast summes.
His predecessor, Dr. Tounson, maried his sister, continued in the see
but a little while, and left severall children unprovided for, so
the king or rather duke of Bucks gave bishop Davenant the bishoprick
out of pure charity[DL]. Sir Anthony Weldon sayes (in his _Court of
King James_), 'twas the only bishoprick that he disposed of without
symony, all others being made merchandise of for the advancement of
his kindred. Bishop Davenant being invested, maried all his nieces to
clergie-men, so he was at no expence for their preferment. He granted
to his nephew (this Dr.) the lease of the great mannour of Poterne,
worth about 1000 _li._ per annum; made him threasurer of the church of
Sarum, of which the corps is the parsonage of Calne, which was esteemed
to be of the like value. He made severall purchases, all which he left
him; insomuch as the churchmen of Sarum say, that he gained more by
this church then ever any man did by the church since the Reformation,
and take it very unkindly that, at his death, he left nothing (or but
50 _li._) to that church which was the source of his estate. How it
happened I know not, or how he might be workt-on in his old age, but I
have heard severall yeares since, he had sett downe 500 _li._ in will
for the Cathedral Church of Sarum.

He had 6 sonnes and 4 daughters. There was a good schoole at
Gillingham: at winter nights he taught his sonnes Arithmetic and
Geometric; his 2 eldest daughters, especially Mris Ettrick, was a
notable Algebrist.

☞ _Memoria._ He had an excellent way of improving his children's
memories, which was thus: he would make one of them read a chapter
or &c., and then they were (_sur le champ_) to repeate what they
remembred, which did exceedingly profitt them; and so for sermons, he
did not let them write notes (which jaded their memorie), but gave an
account _vivâ voce_. When his eldest son, John, came to Winton-schoole
(where the boyes were enjoyned to write sermon notes) he had not wrote;
the master askt him for his notes--he had none, but sayd, 'If I doe not
give you as good an account of it as they that doe, I am much mistaken.'

Pierson[761].

He bought the advowson of Newton-tony, Wilts, which he gave to Queene's

He hung the choire of Sarum with purple velvet, which was plundered in
the sacrilegious times.




=Sir William Davenant= (1605/6-1668).


[763]Sir William Davenant[DN], knight, Poet Laureate, was
borne [about[764] the end of February--vide A. Wood's _Antiq.
Oxon._--baptized 3 of March A.D. 1605/6], in ... street in the city of
Oxford at the Crowne taverne.

His father was John Davenant, a vintner there, a very grave and
discreet citizen: his mother was a very beautifull woman, and of a very
good witt, and of conversation extremely agreable. They had three sons,
viz. 1, Robert[LII.], 2, William[765]; and 3, Nicholas (an attorney):
and two handsome daughters, one married to Gabriel Bridges (B.D.,
fellow of C. C. Coll., beneficed in the Vale of White Horse), another
to Dr. <William> Sherburne (minister of Pembridge in Hereford, and a
canon of that church).

[LII.] Robert[766] was a fellow of St. John's College in Oxon: then
preferred to the parsonage of West Kington by bishop Davenant, whose
chaplaine he was.

Mr. William Shakespeare was wont to goe into Warwickshire once a yeare,
and did commonly in his journey lye at this house in Oxon. where he
was exceedingly respected. [I[767] have heard parson Robert <Davenant>
say that Mr. W. Shakespeare haz given him a hundred kisses.] Now Sir
William would sometimes, when he was pleasant over a glasse of wine
with his most intimate friends--e.g. Sam. Butler (author of Hudibras),
&c.--say, that it seemed to him that he writt with the very spirit
that Shakespeare, and seemd[768] contented[769] enough to be thought
his son. [He[770] would tell them the story as above, in which way his
mother had a very light report[771].]

He went to schoole at Oxon to Mr. Sylvester (Charles Whear, filius
Degorii W., was his schoolefellowe), but I feare he was drawne from
schoole before he was ripe enough.

He was preferred to the first dutches of Richmond to wayte on her as
a page. I remember he told me, she sent him to a famous apothecary for
some Unicornes-horne, which he was resolved to try with a spider which
he incircled[772] in it, but without the expected successe; the spider
would goe over, and thorough and thorough, unconcerned.

He was next a servant (as I remember, a page also) to Sir Fulke
Grevil[773] lord Brookes, with whom he lived to his death, which was
that a servant of his (that had long wayted on him and his lordship
had often told him that he would doe something for him, but did not
but still putt him off with delayes) as he was trussing up his lord's
pointes comeinge from stoole (for then their breeches were fastned to
the doubletts with points--then came in hookes and eies--which not to
have fastened was in my boy-hood a great crime) stabbed him. This was
at the same time that the duke of Buckingham was stabbed by Felton, and
the great noise and report of the duke's, Sir William told me, quite
drowned this of his lord's, that 'twas scarce taken notice of. This Sir
Fulke G. was a good witt, and had been a good poet[774] in his youth.
He wrote a poeme in folio which he printed not till he was old, and
then, (as Sir W. said) with too much judgment and refining, spoyld it,
which was at first a delicate thing.

He writt a play or playes, and verses, which he did with so much
sweetnesse and grace, that by it he got the love and friendship of his
two Mecaenasses, Mr. Endymion Porter, and Mr. Henry Jermyn (since earl
of St. Albans), to whom he has dedicated his poem called _Madegascar_.
Sir John Suckling also was his great and intimate friend.

After the death of Ben Johnson he was made in his place Poet Laureat.

He gott a terrible clap of a black handsome wench that lay in Axe-yard,
Westminster, whom he thought on when he speakes of _Dalga_ in
_Gondibert_, which cost him his nose, with which unlucky mischance many
witts were to<o> cruelly bold: e.g. Sir John Menis, Sir John Denham, &c.

[775]In 1641, when the troubles began, he was faine to fly into France,
and at Canterbury he was seised on by the mayor--vide Sir John Menis'
verses--

    'For Will had in his face the flawes
    And markes recieved in countrey's cause:
    They flew on him like lyons passant,
    And tore his nose as much as was on't,
    And call'd him superstitious groome,
    And Popish Dog, and Cur of Rome.
    . . . . . 'Twas surely the first time
    That Will's religion was a crime.'

In the civill warres in England he was in the army of William, marquess
of Newcastle (since duke), where he was generall of the ordinance. I
have heard his brother Robert say, for that service there was owing to
him by King Charles the First 10000 _li._ During that warre, 'twas his
hap to have two aldermen of Yorke his prisoners, who were something
stubborne, and would not give the ransome ordered by the councell of
warr. Sir William used them civilly, and treated them in his tent,
and sate them at the upper end of his table à la mode de France, and
having donne so a good while to his chardge, told them (privately and
friendly) that he was not able to keepe so chargeable guests, and bad
them take an opportunity to escape, which they did; but having been gon
a little way they considered with themselves that in gratitude they
ought to goe back and give Sir William their thankes; which they did,
but it was like to have been to their great danger of being taken by
the soldiers; but they happened to gett safe to Yorke.

The King's party being overcome, Sir William Davenant (who received the
honour of knighthood from the duke of Newcastle by commision) went into
France; resided chiefly in Paris where the Prince of Wales then was.
He then began to write his romance in verse, called _Gondibert_, and
had not writt above the first booke, but being very fond of it, prints
it (before a quarter finished), with an epistle of his to Mr. Thomas
Hobbes and Mr. Hobbes' excellent epistle to him printed before it. The
courtiers with the Prince of Wales could never be at quiet about this
piece, which was the occasion of a very witty but satericall little
booke of verses in 8vo. about 4 sheetes, writt by George, duke of
Buckes, Sir John Denham, etc.--

    'That thou forsak'st thy sleepe, thy diet,
    And which is more then that, _our quiet_.'

This last word Mr. Hobs told me was the occasion of their writing.

Here he layd an ingeniose designe to carry a considerable number of
artificers (chiefly weavers) from hence to Virginia; and by Mary the
queen-mother's meanes, he got favour from the king of France to goe
into the prisons and pick and choose. So when the poor dammed wretches
understood what the designe was, the<y> cryed _uno ore_--'_Tout
tisseran!_' i.e. _We are all weavers!_ Will. <took> 36, as I remember,
if not[776]more, and shipped them; and[777] as he was in his voyage
towards Virginia, he and his _tisseran_ were all taken by the shippes
then belonging to the Parliament of England. The slaves I suppose
they sold, but Sir William was brought prisoner to England. Whither
he was first a prisoner at Caresbroke-castle in the Isle of Wight, or
at the Tower of London, I have forgott: he was a prisoner at both.
His _Gondibert_, 4to, was finished at Caresbroke-castle. He expected
no mercy from the Parliament, and had no hopes of escaping <with> his
life. It pleased God that the two aldermen of Yorke aforesayd hearing
that he was taken and brought to London to be tryed for his life, which
they understood was in extreme danger, they were touch<ed> with so
much generosity and goodnes, as, upon their owne accounts and meer
motion, to try what they could to save Sir William's life who had been
so civill to them and a meanes to save theirs, to come to London: and
acquainting the Parliament with it, upon their petition, etc., Sir
William's life was saved[LIII.].

[LIII.] 'Twas Harry Martyn that saved Sir William Davenant's life in
the Howse.--When they were talking of sacrificing one, then said Henry
that 'in sacrifices they always offered pure and without blemish: now
yee talke of making a sacrifice of an old rotten rascall.' Vide H.
Martyn's Life, where by _this very jest_, then[778] forgot, the lord
Falkland saved H. Martyn's Life.

Being freed from imprisonment, (because playes, scil. Tragedies and
Comoedies, were in those Presbyterian times scandalous) he contrives
to set-up an Opera _stylo recitativo_, wherein serjeant Maynard
and severall citizens were engagers. It began at Rutland-house,
in Charter-house-yard; next, (scil. anno ...) at the Cock-pitt in
Drury-lane, where were acted very well _stylo recitativo_, _Sir Francis
Drake's ..._, and _the Siege of Rhodes_ (1st and 2d part). It did
affect the eie and eare extremely. This first brought scenes in fashion
in England; before, at playes, was only a hanging.

Anno Domini 1660 was the happy restauration of his majestie Charles
II. Then was Sir Wm. made ...; and the Tennis court in Little
Lincolnes-Inne fielde was turn'd into a play-house for the duke of
Yorke's players, where Sir William had lodgeings, and where he dyed,
April the <7th> 166<8>[LIV.].

[LIV.] It is now a Tennis court again, upon the building of the duke's
house in Dorset garden.

I was at his funerall. He had a coffin of walnutt-tree; Sir[779] John
Denham sayd 'twas the finest coffin that ever he sawe.[780]His body was
carried in a herse from the play-house to Westminster-Abbey, where,
at the great west dore, he was recieved by the sing<ing> men and
choristers, who sang the service of the church ('I am the Resurrection,
&c.') to his[LV.] grave, which is in the south crosse aisle, on which,
on a paving stone of marble, is writt, in imitation of that on Ben
Johnson, '_O rare Sir Will. Davenant_.'

[LV.] Which is neer to the monument of Dr. Isaac
Barrow.--Memorandum:--my honoured friend Sir Robert Moray lies by him;
but _sans_ inscription.

His first lady was Dr. ...'s daughter, physitian, ... by whom he had
a very beautifull and ingeniose son that dyed above 20 yeares since.
His 2d lady was the daughter of ... by whom he had severall children:
I sawe some very young ones at the funerall. His eldest is Charles
Davenant, LL.Dr., who inherits his father's beauty and phancy[781]. He
practises at Doctors Commons. He writt a play called _Circe_, which haz
taken very well.

Sir William hath writt about 25 (quaere) playes; the romance called
_Gondibert_; and a little poeme called _Madagascar_.

His private opinion was that Religion at last,--e.g. a hundred yeares
hence,--would come to settlement, and that in a kind of ingeniose
Quakerisme.

[782]That sweet swan of Isis, Sir William Davenant, dyed the seaventh
day of April last, and lyes buried amongst the poets in Westminster
abbey[783], by his antagonist, Mr. Thomas May, whose inscription of
whose marble was taken away by order since the king came in.

Sir William was Poet Laureat; and Mr. John Dryden hath his place. But
me thought it had been proper that a laurell should have been sett on
his coffin--which was not donne.

He hath writt above 20 playes; besides his _Gondibert_ and _Madagascar_.


_Note._

[DN] Aubrey gives in trick the Davenant coat, _ut supra_, p. 203, but
wreathed in laurel: see the facsimile at the end of vol. iv. of Clark's
Wood's _Life and Times_.




=John Davenport= (1597-1669/70).


[784]Sir John Dugdale told me that he would enquire about Mr. John
Davenport, and send to you.--This was halfe a yeare since, at least.

[785]Sir John Dugdale saith that John Davenport was a nonconformist;
and he hath enquired of his relations, who know nothing of him, if
dead or alive, but they believe he is dead. He went over sea--he
thinkes to the Barbadoes, or some of these plantations[786], or to
Holland.




=John Davys= (1550-1605).


[787]Memorandum:--Mr. Browne, the mathematicall instrument maker of
the Minories, told me that the sea-quadrant was invented by Captaine
Davy ... yeares since,--he that found out the streights called Davys's
Streights.




=Arthur Dee= (1579-1651).


[788]'Arthur Dee,' (sonne of John Dee), a physitian at Norwych, 'was
born 13 Julii 1579, manè, horâ 4. 30´ fere (vel potius, 25 min.)
in ipso ortu solis, ut existimo'--Thus I find it in his father's
_Ephemerides_.

Obiit Norwychi about 1650.

[789]<Arthur Dee told Dr. Bathurst and Dr. Wharton> 'that (being but a
boy) he used[LVI.] to play at quoits with the plates of gold made by
projection in the garret of Dr. Dee's lodgings in Prague.... When he
was 9 yeares of age and at Trebona in Germany with his father, he was
design'd to succede Kelly as his father's speculator.'

[LVI.] Mrs. Dee, wife to his son Mr. Rowland Dee, told me the other day
that Dr. Arthur Dee hath often told her the same.

[790]<Arthur Dee> 'has often told Mr. Whitefoot, of Norwich, who buried
him, that he had more than once seen the philosopher's stone, and he
thinks that he has written some peice on that subject. He was a man of
a very pleasant conversation and had good practice in Norwich: a great
acquaintance of Dr. <Thomas> Browne's.'




=John Dee= (1527-1608).


[791]John Dee:--Mr. Ashmole hath his nativitie. Resp.--'tis in his
_Theatrum Chemicum_. Hee had a very faire cleare rosie complexion: so
had the earl of Rochester, exceeding.

[792]'Johannes Dee, natus Londini, 1527, Julii 13, 4ʰ 2´ P.M.'--this
nativity[DO] I copied out of the learned John Dee's papers in the hands
of Elias Ashmole, esq.

[793]From Elias Ashmole--the father of this John Dee was a vintner in
... London.

[794]John Dee--from Meredith Lloyd:--Talbot, marying an inheritresse
of the prince of South Wales (who was descended from Howel Da, i.e.
Howelus bonus: the same family from whom John Dee was descended).--Dr.
Troutbec hath Raymund Lully's ... (a chymical tract) with John Dee's
marginall notes.

[795]I left about 1674, with Mr. Elias Ashmole, 3 pages in folio
concerning him[DP].

Memorandum:--Mr. Meredith Lloyd tells me that his father was Roland
Dee[DQ], a Radnorshire gentleman[LVII.], and that he hath his pedegree,
which he hath promised to lend to me. He was descended from Rees,
prince of South Wales.

[LVII.] J. Dee's father was a vintner in London at the signe of ... in
...: from Elias Ashmole, esqre, who had it from his grandsonne (sonne
of Arthur).

My great-grandfather, William Aubrey (LL.Dr.), and he were cosins, and
intimate acquaintance. Mr. Ashmole hath letters between them, under
their owne hands, viz. one of Dr. W. A. to him[796] (ingeniosely and
learnedly written) touching the _Sovraignty of the Sea_, of which J.
D. writt a booke which he dedicated to queen Elizabeth and desired my
great grandfather's advice upon it. Dr. A.'s countrey-house was at
Kew, and J. Dee lived at Mortlack, not a mile distant. I have heard my
grandmother say they were often together.

Arthur Dee, M.D., his son, lived and practised at Norwich, an intimate
friend of Sir Thomas Browne, M.D., who told me that Sir William
Boswell, the Dutch ambassador, had all John Dee's MSS.: quaere his
executors for his papers. He[797] lived then somewhere in Kent.

Memorandum:--Sir William Boswell's widowe lives at Bradburne, neer
Swynoke, in Kent. Memorandum:--Mr. Hake, of the Physitians' Colledge,
hath a MS. of Mr. John Dee's, which see or gett.

Quaere A. Wood for the MSS. in the Bodlean library of Doctor Gwyn,
wherein[798] are severall letters between him and John Dee, and Doctor
Davies, of chymistrey and of magicall secrets, which my worthy friend
Mr. Meredith Lloyd hath seen and read: and he tells me that he haz been
told that Dr. Barlowe gave it to the Prince of Tuscany[799].

Meredith Lloyd sayes that John Dee's printed booke of Spirits, is
not above the third part of what was writt, which were in Sir Robert
Cotton's library; many whereof were much perished by being buryed, and
Sir Robert Cotton bought the field to digge after it.

Memorandum:--he told me of John Dee, etc., conjuring at a poole[LVIII.]
in Brecknockshire, and that they found a wedge of gold; and that they
were troubled and indicted as conjurers at the assizes; that a mighty
storme and tempest was raysed in harvest time, the countrey people had
not knowen the like.

[LVIII.] Vide Almanac, about the poole in Brecon.

His picture in a wooden cutt is at the end of Billingsley's Euclid,
but Mr. Elias Ashmole hath a very good painted copie of him from his
sonne Arthur. He had a very fair, clear[800] complexione (as Sir Henry
Savile); a long beard as white as milke. A very handsome man.

                         Investigatio cinerum △

Old goodwife Faldo[DR] (a natif of Mortlak in Surrey), 80+ aetatis
(1672[801]), did know Dr. Dee, and told me he dyed at his howse in
Mortlack, next to the howse where the tapistry hangings are made, viz.
west of that howse; and that he dyed about 60+, 8 or 9 yeares since
(January, 1672), and lies buried in the chancell, and had a stone
(marble) upon him. Her mother tended him in his sicknesse. She told me
that he did entertain the Polonian ambassador at his howse in Mortlak,
and dyed not long after; and that he shewed the eclipse with a darke
roome to the said ambassador[LIX.]. She beleeves that he was eightie
years old when he dyed. She sayd, he kept a great many stilles goeing.
That he layd the storme Sir Everard Digby. That the children dreaded
him because he was accounted a conjurer. He recovered the basket
of cloathes stollen, when she and his daughter (both girles) were
negligent: she knew this.

[LIX.] A Brief History of Muscovia, by Mr. John Milton, Lond. 1682,
pag. 100, scil. 1588. 'Dr. Giles Fletcher went ambassador from the
Queen to Pheodor then emperour; whose relations, being judicious and
exact, are best read entirely by themselves. This emperour, upon report
of the great learning <of> the mathematician, invited him to Mosco,
with offer of two thousand pound a-yeare, and from Prince Boris one
thousand markes; to have his provision from the emperor's table, to be
honourably recieved, and accounted as one of the chief men in the land.
All which Dee accepted not.'

He is buried (upon the matter) in the middest of the chancell, a little
towards the south side. She sayd, he lies buried in the chancell
between Mr. Holt and Mr. Miles, both servants to queen Elizabeth, and
both have brasse inscriptions on their marble, and that there was on
him a marble, but without any inscription, which marble is removed; on
which old marble is signe of two or three brasse pinnes. A daughter of
his (I thinke, Sarah) maried to a flax-dresser, in Southwarke: quaere
nomen.

He dyed within a yeare, if not shortly, after the king of Denmark
was here: vide Sir Richard Baker's _Chronicle_ and Capt. Wharton's
_Almanac_.

[802]He built the gallery in the church at Mortlak. Goody Faldo's
father was the carpenter that work't it.

A stone was on his grave, which is since removed. At the upper end
of the chancell then were steppes, which in Oliver's dayes were layd
plaine by the minister, and then 'twas removed. The children when they
played in the church would runne to Dr. Dee's grave-stone. She told me
that he forewarned Q. Elizabeth of Dr. Lopez attempt against her (the
Dr. bewrayed, ---- himselfe).

He used to distill egge-shells, and 'twas from hence that Ben Johnson
had his hint of the alkimist, whom he meant.

He was a great peace-maker; if any of the neighbours fell out, he would
never lett them alone till he had made them friends.

He was tall and slender. He wore a gowne like an artist's gowne, with
hanging sleeves, and a slitt.

A mighty good man he was.

He was sent ambassador for Queen Elizabeth (shee thinkes) into Poland.

Memorandum:--his regayning of the plate for ...'s butler, who comeing
from London by water with a basket of plate, mistooke another basket
that was like his. Mr. J. Dee bid them goe by water such a day, and
looke about, and he should see the man that had his basket, and he
did so; but he would not gett the lost horses, though he was offered
severall angells. He told a woman (his neighbour) that she laboured
under the evill tongue of an ill neighbour (another woman), which came
to her howse, who he sayd was a witch.

    In J. David Rhesus' _British Grammar_, p. 60:--'Juxta Crucis
    amnem (_Nant y groes_), in agro _Maessyuetiano_, apud
    Cambro-brytannos, erat olim illustris quaedam _Nigrorum_
    familia, unde _Joan Du_, id est, _Johannes_ ille cognomento

_Notes._

[DO] In MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 36, Aubrey gives the horoscope, with
astrological notes, e.g. that there is 'a reception between Saturn and
Luna,' that 'Jupiter is in his exaltation and lord of the ascendant,'
etc.

[DP] In MS. Aubr. 7, fol. 6, Aubrey notes:--'vide the new additions in
John Dee's life.' This perhaps refers to MS. Aubr. 6, foll. 36-38, as
being additional to the paper which he here says he left with Ashmole.

[DQ] In MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 37, Aubrey gives in colours the coat,
'gules, a lion rampant within a bordure indented or,' adding the
note:--'Memorandum in the scutcheon at the beginning of his preface the
bordure is engrailed: I believe that is the truest, for 'twas donne
with care--sed quaere.'

In MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 36ᵛ, he gives in trick the coat for Dee's match
'1578, Febr. 5,' with Jane Fromundz, viz.:--'in the 1 and 6, gules, a
lion rampant within a bordure engrailed or [Dee]; in the 2, or, a lion
rampant gules [ ...]; in the 3, ..., a lion rampant crowned sable [
...]; in the 4, azure, a lion rampant ... [Dun]; in the 5, argent, on
2 bends gules 6 cross crosslets or [ ...],' as the coat of John Dee;
impaling 'per chevron ermines and gules, a chevron between 3 fleur de
lys or' [Fromundz], for Jane Fromundz. The motto is 'A Domino factum
est istud.'

[DR] Aubrey's conversation with 'goodwife Faldo,' written down at the
time (Oct. 22, 1672), is found in a letter to Anthony Wood, in MS. Wood
F. 39, fol. 192.

    3 or 4 or but 2 of these may doe well enough[806] etc. Yet
    as to preferrment, etc.--In Aug. 1667, I was courted by the
    old earle of Pembrook[807] to be his chiefe steward; but, hee
    always vexed with false informations against me, I left his
    ymployment.'

[808]Memorandum:--Mr. Th. Deer is now (Jan. 1677/8) in prison at
Fisherton-Anger.




=Gideon de Laune= (1565?-1659).


[809]... De Laune:--he was apothecary to Mary the queen mother: came
into England....

He was a very wise man, and as a signe[810] of it left an estate of
80,000 _li._

Sir William Davenant was his great acquaintance and told me of him,
and that after his returne into England he went to visit him, being
then octogenary, and very decrepit with the gowt, but had his sight and
understanding. He had a place made for him in the kitchen chimney; and,
_non obstante_ he was master of such an estate, Sir William sawe him
slighted not only by his daughter-in-lawe, but by the cooke-mayd, which
much affected him--misery of old age.

He wrote a booke of prudentiall advice, in quadrans, 8vo, in English
verse, which I have seen, and there are good things in it.




=Sir John Denham= (1615-1668/9).


[811]Sir John Denham was unpolished with the small-pox: otherwise a
fine complexion.

[812]From Anthony Wood:--in the Matriculation booke he finds it thus
written--'Johannes Denham, Essex, filius Johannis Denham de Horseley
parva in com. praed., militis, aetat. 16, 1631.'

[813]Sir John Denham[DS], Knight of the Bath, was borne at Dublin in
Ireland, anno Domini....

Quaere Dr. Buzby if he was a Westminster schollar--I have forgot. Anno
... he was admitted of Trinity Colledge in Oxford, where he stayed....
His tutor there was.... I have heard Mr. Josias Howe say that he was
the dreamingst young fellow; he never expected such things from him
as he haz left the world. When he was there he would game extremely;
when he had played away all his money he would play away his father's
wrought rich gold cappes.

His father was Sir John Denham, one of the Barons of the Exchequer. He
had been one of the Lords Justices in Ireland: he maried Ellenor[LX.],
one of the daughters of Sir Garret Moore, knight, lord baron of
Mellifont, in the kingdome of Ireland, whom he maried during his
service in Ireland in the place of Chief Justice there.

[LX.] She was a beautifull woman, as appeares by her monument at Egham.
Sir John, they say, did much resemble his father.

From Trinity Colledge he went to Lincolnes-Inne, where (as judge Wadham
Windham[814], who was his contemporary, told me) he was as good a
student as any in the house. Was not suspected to be a witt.

At last, viz. 1640, his play of _The Sophy_ came out, which did take
extremely: Mr. Edmund Waller sayd then of him, that he _broke-out like
the Irish Rebellion[LXI.]--threescore thousand strong_, before any body
was aware[815].

[LXI.] His play came out at that time.

He was much rooked by gamesters, and fell acquainted with that
unsanctified crew, to his ruine. His father had some suspition of it,
and chid him severely, wherupon his son John (only child) wrot a little
essay in 8vo, printed ..., _Against[LXII.] gameing and to shew the
vanities and inconveniences of it_, which he presented to his father to
let him know his detestation of it[DT]. But shortly after his father's
death[LXIII.] (who left 2,000 or 1,500 _li._ in ready money, 2 houses
well furnished, and much plate) the money was played away first, and
next the plate was sold. I remember about 1646 he lost 200 _li._ one
night at New-cutt. Anno ... (I ghesse 1642) he was high-sheriff of the
countie of Surrey.

[LXII.] Vide Justus Turcaeus[816] _de lusu aleae_, where he proves 'tis
a disease and that it proceeds from pride, and that the Spaniards (the
proudest nation) are most[817] addicted to it.

[LXIII.] January 6, 1638[818], sepult. at Egham in Surrey.

At the beginning of the civill warre he was made governor of
Farnham-castle for the king, but he was but a young soldier, and
did not keepe it. In 1642/3, after Edghill fight, his poeme called
_Cowper's Hill_ was printed at Oxford, in a sort of browne paper, for
then they could gett no better.

1646/7 (quaere) he conveyed, or stole away, the two dukes of Yorke
and Glocester from St. James's (from the tuition of the earle of
Northumberland), and conveyed them into France to the Prince of Wales
and Queen-mother. King Charles II sent him and the lord Culpepper
envoyes to the king of Poland,....

Anno 1652, he returned into England, and being in some straights was
kindly entertayned by the earle of Pembroke at Wilton, where I had the
honour to contract an acquaintance with him. Here he translated the
... booke of Vergil's _Æneis_, and also burlesqu't it[LXIV.]: quaere
Mr. Christopher Wase who was then there, tutor to William[819], lord
Herbert. He was, as I remember, a yeare with my lord of Pembroke at
Wilton and London; he had then sold all the lands his father had left
him.

[LXIV.] He burlesqued Virgil, and burnt it, sayeing that 'twas not fitt
that the best poet should be so abused.--From Mr. Christopher Wase.

His first wife was the daughter and heire of ... Cotton, of ... in
Glocestershire, by whom he had 500 _li._ per annum, one son and two
daughters.[820]His son did not _patrem sapere_. He was of Wadham
College[821] in Dr. Wilkins's time: he dyed _sine prole_, I thinke,
there.--One of his daughters is maried to ... Morley, of Sussex, esq.;
the other....

He was much beloved by King Charles the First, who much valued him for
his ingenuity. He graunted him the reversion of the surveyor of his
majestie's buildings, after the decease of Mr. Inigo Jones; which
place, after the restauration of King Charles II he enjoyed to his
death, and gott seaven thousand pounds, as Sir Christopher Wren told me
of, to his owne knowledge. Sir Christopher Wren was his deputie.

Anno Domini 166.. he maried his 2d wife, <Margaret> Brookes, a very
beautifull young lady; Sir John was ancient and limping. The duke
of Yorke fell deepely in love with her, though (I have been morally
assured) he never had carnall knowledge of her. This occasioned Sir
John's distemper of madnesse in 166.., which first appeared when he
went from London to see the famous free-stone quarries at Portland in
Dorset, and when he came within a mile of it, turned back to London
again, and did[822] not see it. He went to Hownslowe, and demanded
rents of lands he had sold many yeares before; went to the king, and
told him he was the Holy Ghost. But it pleased God that he was cured
of this distemper, and writt excellent verses (particularly on the
death of Mr. Abraham Cowley) afterwards. His 2d lady had no child; was
poysoned by the hands of Co. of Roc.[823] with chocolatte.

At the coronation of King Charles II he was made Knight of the Bath.

He dyed (vide A. Wood's _Antiq. Oxon._) at the house of his office
(which he built, as also the brick-buildings next the street in
Scotland-yard), and was buried, anno Domini 1668/9, March the 23, in
the south crosse aisle of Westminster Abbey, neer Sir Jeffrey Chaucer's
monument, but hitherto (1680) without any memoriall for him.

Memorandum:--the parsonage-house at Egham (vulgarly called _The Place_)
was built by baron Denham; a house very convenient, not great, but
pretty, and pleasantly scituated, and in which his son, Sir John,
(though he had better seates), did take most delight in. He sold it
to John Thynne, esq. In this parish is a place called Cammomill-hill,
from the cammomill that growes there naturally; as also west of it is
Prune-well-hill (formerly part of Sir John's possessions), where was
a fine tuft of trees, a clear spring, and a pleasant prospect to the
east, over the levell of Middlesex and Surrey. Sir John tooke great
delight in this place, and was wont to say (before the troubles) that
he would build there a retiring-place to entertaine his muses; but
the warres forced him to sell that as well as the rest. He sold it to
Mr. ... Anstey. In this parish W. and by N. (above _Runney Meade_) is
_Cowper's Hill_, from whence is a noble prospect, which is incomparably
well described by that sweet swan, Sir John Denham; printed first at
Oxon shortly after Edghill fight, 1642/3.

Memorandum:--he delighted much in bowles, and did bowle very well.

He was of the tallest, but a little incurvetting at his shoulders, not
very robust. His haire was but thin and flaxen, with a moist curle. His
gate was slow, and was rather a stalking (he had long legges), which
was wont to putt me in mind of Horace, _De Arte Poetica_:--

    'Hic, dum sublimes versus ructatur, et errat
    Si veluti merulis intentus decidit auceps
    In puteum foveamve:'----

His eie was a kind of light goose-gray, not big; but it had a strange
piercingness, not as to shining and glory, but (like a Momus) when he
conversed with you he look't into your very thoughts.

He was generally temperate as to drinking; but one time when he was
a student of Lincolne's-Inne, having been merry at the taverne with
his camerades, late at night, a frolick came into his head, to gett a
playsterer's brush and a pott of inke, and blott out all the signes
between Temple-barre and Charing-crosse, which made a strange confusion
the next day, and 'twas in Terme time. But it happened that they were
discovered, and it cost him and them some moneys. This I had from R.
Estcott[824], esq., that carried the inke-pott.

In the time of the civill warres, George Withers, the poet, begged Sir
John Denham's estate at Egham of the Parliament, in whose cause he was
a captaine of horse. It <happened> that G. W. was taken prisoner, and
was in danger of his life, having written severely against the king,
&c. Sir John Denham went to the king, and desired his majestie not to
hang him, for that whilest G. W. lived he should not be the worst poet
in England.

Scripsit _the Sophy_: _Cowper's Hill_: _Essay against Gameing_: Poems,
8vo, printed anno Domini ...; Cato Major sive De Senectute, translated
into English verse, London, printed by H. Heringman, in the New
Exchange, 1669.

Memorandum:--in the verses against Gondibert, most of them are Sir
John's. He was satyricall when he had a mind to it.


_Notes._

[DS] Aubrey gives in colours the coat: 'gules, 3 lozenges ermine
[Denham],' surrounded by laurels. He adds the note:--'this coate is
in stone and thus coloured, on the roofe or vaulting of the cathedral
church at Winchester: Sir John told me his family was originally
westerne.' He adds the reference 'vide A. Wood's Hist. Oxon.'

[DT] Aubrey, in MS. Wood F. 39, fol. 193, writing Oct. 22, 1672,
says:--'Sir John Denham wrott an essay against gameing, to shew his
detestation of it to his father, printed by N. Brookes, at the Angel
in Cornhill. I have it, about 3 or 4 sheetes, 8vo. His name is not to
it, but I know 'twas his; and a kinsman of his, that was one of his
father's clarkes, gave the copy to Brookes: and Sir John Denham owned
it to me.'




=René Descartes= (1596-1650/1).


[825]Monsieur Renatus Des Cartes,

'nobilis Gallus, Perroni dominus, summus mathematicus et philosophus;
natus Hagae Turonum pridie Calendas Apriles, 1596; denatus Holmiae
Calendis Februarii, 1650'--this inscription I find under his picture
graved by C. V. Dalen.

How he spent his time in his youth, and by what method he became so
knowing, he tells the world in his treatise entituled Of Method. The
Societie of Jesus glorie in that theyr order had the educating of him.
He lived severall yeares at Egmont (neer the Hague), from whence
he dated severall of his bookes. He was too wise a man to encomber
himselfe with a wife; but as he was a man, he had the desires and
appetites of a man; he therefore kept a good conditioned hansome woman
that he liked, and by whom he had some children (I thinke 2 or 3). 'Tis
pity but comeing from the braine[826] of such a father, they should be
well cultivated. He was so eminently learned that all learned men made
visits to him, and many of them would desire him to shew them his ...
of instruments (in those dayes mathematicall learning lay much in the
knowledge of instruments, and, as Sir H. S.[827] sayd, in doeing of
tricks), he would drawe out a little drawer under his table, and shew
them a paire of compasses with one of the legges broken; and then, for
his ruler, he used a sheet of paper folded double. This from Alexander
Cowper (brother of Samuel), limner to Christina, queen of Sweden, who
was familiarly acquainted there with Des Cartes.

[828]Mr. Hobbes was wont to say that had Des Cartes kept himselfe wholy
to geometrie that he had been the best geometer in the world. He did
very much admire him, but sayd that he could not pardon him for writing
in the defence of transubstantiation which he knew to bee absolutely
against his judgment[829]--quod N. B.




=Robert Devereux=, earl of Essex (1567-1600/1).


[830]Ex registro capellae Turris London, scil. 1600[831], 'Robert,
earle of Essex, beheaded, Febr. 6th.'

From my lady Elizabeth, viscountesse Purbec, repeated by her:--

    1.  There is none, oh none but you,
        Who from me estrange your sight,
        Whom mine eyes affect to view
        And chained eares heare with delight.

    2. Others' beauties others move,
        In you I all graces find:
        Such are the effects of love
        To make them happy that are kind.

    3.  Woemen in fraile beauty trust,
        Only seeme you kind to me,
        Still be truly kind and just
        For that can't dissembled bee.

    4.  Deare, afford me then your sight,
        That surveighing all your lookes
        Endlesse volumnes I may write
        And fill the world with envyed bookes.

    5.  Which when after ages view
        All shall wonder and despayre,
        Women, to find a man so true,
        And men, a woeman halfe so faire--

made by Robert, earl of Essex, that was beheaded.

[832]The tradition is that the bell of Lincoln's-Inne was brought
from Cales (Cadiz), tempore reginae Elizabethae, plundered in the
expedition[833] under <Robert Devereux>, earl of Essex.




=Sir Everard Digby= (1578-1605/6).


[834]Sir Everard Digby (father of Sir Kenelme) scripsit libellum Latinè
cui titulus:--

Everardi Dygbei de duplici methodo--

in 8vo, in dialogues.

I have heard Mr. John Digby say (his grandsonne) that he was the
handsomest man (accounted) in England.

[835]Sir Everard Digby was a most gallant gentleman and one of the
handsomest men of his time. He writt something in Latin _de methodo_,
which I did light upon 23 yeares ago at a country man's howse in
Herefordshire; and Mr. Francis Potter told me he writt _de arte
natandi_.

'Twas his ill fate to suffer in the powder-plott. When his heart was
pluct out by the executioner (who, _secundum formam_, cryed 'Here is
the heart of a traytor!'), it is credibly reported, he replied, 'Thou
liest!' This my lord Bacon speakes of, but not mentioning his name, in
his _Historia vitae et mortis_.




=Sir Kenelm Digby= (1603-1665).


[836]Sir Kenelm Digby[DU], knight: he was borne at <Gotehurst, Bucks>
on the eleventh of June[DV]: see Ben: Johnson, 2d volumne:--

    'Witnesse thy actions done at Scanderoon
    Upon _thy_ birthday, the eleaventh of June.'

[Memorandum:--in the first impression in 8vo it is thus; but in the
folio 'tis _my_, instead of _thy_.]

Mr. Elias Ashmole assures me, from two or three nativities by Dr.
<Richard> Nepier, that Ben: Johnson was mistaken and did it for the
ryme-sake.--In Dr. Napier's papers of nativities, with Mr. Ashmole,
I find:--'Sir Kenelme Digby natus July 11, 5ʰ 40´ A.M. 1603, 14
Leo ascending,' and another scheme gives it at '4ʰ A.M., 26 Cancer
ascending'; and there are two others of Cancer and Leo.

He was the eldest son of Sir Everard Digby, who was accounted the
handsomest gentleman in England. Sir Everard sufferd as a traytor
in the gunpowder-treason; but king James restored his estate to his
son and heire. Mr. Francis Potter told me that Sir Everard wrote
a booke _De Arte Natandi_. I have a Latin booke of his writing in
8vo:--Everardi[837] Dygbei _De duplici methodo libri duo_, in dialogues
'inter Aristotelicum et Ramistam,' in 8vo: the title page is torne
out.--His second son was Sir John Digby, as valiant a gentleman and as
good a swordman as was in England, who dyed (or was killed[LXV.]) in
the king's cause at Bridgewater, about 1644.

[LXV.] I can easily learne, if you desire it[838].

It happened in 1647 that a grave was opened next to Sir John Digby's
(who was buried in summer time, it seemes), and the flowers on his
coffin were found fresh, as I heard Mr. Harcourt (that was executed)
attest that very yeare. Sir John died a batchelour.

Sir Kenelme Digby was held to be the most accomplished cavalier of his
time. He went to Glocester hall in Oxon, anno <1618> (vide A. Wood's
_Antiq. Oxon._). The learned Mr. Thomas Allen (then of that house) was
wont to say that he was the _Mirandula_ of his age. He did not weare a
gowne there[839], as I have heard my cosen Whitney say.

There was a great friendship between him and Mr. Thomas Allen; whether
he was his scholar I know not. Mr. Allen was one of the learnedest men
of this nation in his time, and a great collector of good bookes, which
collection Sir Kenelme bought (Mr. Allen enjoyeing the use of them for
his life) to give to the Bodlean Library, after Mr. Allen's decease,
where they[840] now are.

He was a great traveller, and understood 10 or 12 languages. He was
not only master of a good and gracefull judicious stile, but he also
wrote a delicate hand, both fast-hand and Roman. I have seen lettres
of his writing to the father[841] of this earle of Pembroke, who much
respected[842] him.

He was such a goodly handsome person, gigantique and great voice, and
had so gracefull elocution and noble addresse, etc., that had he been
drop't out of the clowdes[843] in any part of the world, he would have
made himselfe respected. But the Jesuites spake spitefully, and sayd
'twas true, but then he must not stay there above six weekes. He was
envoyé from Henrietta Maria (then Queen-mother) to Pope <Innocent X>
where at first he was mightily admired; but after some time he grew
high, and hectored with his holinesse, and gave him the lye. The pope
sayd he was mad.

He was well versed in all kinds of learning. And he had also this
vertue[844], that no man _knew better how to abound, and to be abased_,
and either was indifferent to him. No man became grandeur better[845];
sometimes again he would live only with a lackey, and horse with a
foote-cloath.

He was very generous, and liberall to deserving persons. When Abraham
Cowley was but 13 yeares old, he dedicated to him a comedy[846], called
_Love's Riddle_, and concludes in his epistle[847]--'The Birch that
whip't him then would prove a Bay.' Sir K. was very kind to him.

When he was at Rome one time, (I thinke he was envoyé from Mary
the Queen-mother to Pope <Innocent X>) he contrasted[848] with his
holinesse.

Anno ... (quaere the countesse of Thanet) much against his mother's,
etc., consent, he maried that celebrated beautie and courtezane, Mrs.
Venetia Stanley, whom Richard earle of Dorset kept as his concubine,
had children by her, and setled on her an annuity of 500 _li._ per
annum; which after Sir K. D. maried was unpayd by the earle; and for
which annuity Sir Kenelme sued the earle, after mariage, and recovered
it. He would say that a handsome lusty man that was discreet might make
a vertuose wife out of a brothell-house. This lady carried herselfe
blamelessly, yet (they say) he was jealous of her[LXVI.]. She dyed
suddenly, and hard-hearted woemen[849] would censure him severely.

[LXVI.] Richard earle of Dorset invited her and her husband once a
yeare, when, with much desire and passion he beheld her, and only
kissed her hand; Sir Kenelme being still by.

After her death, to avoyd envy and scandall, he retired in to Gresham
Colledge at London, where he diverted himselfe with his chymistry,
and the professors' good conversation. He wore there a long mourning
cloake, a high crowned hatt, his beard unshorne, look't like a hermite,
as signes of sorrowe for his beloved wife, to whose memory he erected
a sumptuouse monument, now quite destroyed by the great conflagration.
He stayed at the colledge[850] two or 3 yeares.

The faire howses in Holbourne, between King's street and Southampton
street, (which brake-off the continuance of them) were, about 1633,
built by Sir Kenelme; where he lived before the civill warres. Since
the restauration of Charles II he lived in the last faire house
westward in the north portico of Convent garden, where my lord Denzill
Hollis lived since. He had a laboratory there. I thinke he dyed in this
house--sed quaere.

He was, 164.., prisoner for the king (Charles I) at Winchester-house,
where he practised chymistry[851], and wrote his booke of[852] Bodies
and Soule, which he dedicated to his eldest son, Kenelme, who was
slaine (as I take it) in the earle of Holland's riseing[853].

Anno 163 ... tempore Caroli Iᵐⁱ he received the sacrament in the
chapell at Whitehall, and professed the Protestant religion, which gave
great scandal to the Roman Catholiques; but afterwards he _looked back_.

He was a person of very extraordinary strength. I remember one
at[854]Shirburne (relating to the earl of Bristoll) protested to us,
that as he, being a midling man, being sett in <a> chaire, Sir Kenelme
tooke up him, chaire and all, with one arme.

He was of an undaunted courage, yet not apt in the least to give
offence. His conversation was both ingeniose and innocent.

Mr. Thomas White, who wrote _de Mundo_, 1641[855], and Mr. ... Hall of
Leige, e societate Jesu, were two of his great friends.

As for that great action of his at Scanderoon, see the Turkish
Historie. Sir <Edward> Stradling, of Glamorganshire, was then his
vice-admirall, at whose house is an excellent picture of his, as he
was at that time: by him is drawen an armillary sphaere broken, and
undernethe is writt IMPAVIDUM FERIENT (Horace). See excellent verses of
Ben: Johnson (to whome he was a great patrone) in his 2d volumne.

There is in print in French, and also in English (translated by Mr.
James Howell), a speech that he made at a philosophicall assembly at
Montpelier, 165.. _Of the sympathetique powder_--see it[856]. He made
a speech at the beginning of the meeting of the Royall Society _Of the
vegetation of plants_.

He was borne to three thousand pounds per annum. His ancient seat (I
thinke) is Gote-herst in Buckinghamshire. He had a fair estate also
in Rutlandshire. What by reason of the civil warres, and his generous
mind, he contracted great debts, and I know not how (there being a
great falling out between him and his _then_ only son, John[LXVII.]) he
settled his estate upon ... Cornwalleys, a subtile sollicitor[857], and
also a member of the House of Commons, who did putt Mr. John Digby to
much charge in lawe: quaere what became of it?

[LXVII.] He married ... sister to this present Henry, duke of Norfolke,
no child living by her. His 2d wife ... Fortescue, by whom he haz ...
Quaere the issue?

Mr. J. D. had a good estate of his owne, and lived handsomely then
at what time I went to him two or 3 times in order to your _Oxon.
Antiqu._; and he then brought me a great book, as big as the biggest
Church Bible that ever I sawe, and the richliest bound, bossed with
silver, engraven with scutchions and crest (an ostrich); it was a
curious velame[858]. It was the history of the family of the Digbyes,
which Sir Kenelme either did, or ordered to be donne. There was
inserted all that was to be found any where relating to them, out
of records of the Tower, rolles, &c. All ancient church monuments
were most exquisitely limmed by some rare artist. He told me that
the compileing of it did cost his father a thousand pound. Sir Jo.
Fortescue sayd he did beleeve 'twas more. When Mr. John Digby did me
the favour to shew me this rare MS., 'This booke,' sayd he, 'is all
that I have left me of all the estate that was my father's!' He was
almost as tall and as big as his father: he had something[859] of the
sweetnesse of his mother's face. He was bred by the Jesuites, and was a
good scholar. He dyed at....

Vide in ... Lives when Sir Kenelme dyed.

Sir John Hoskyns enformes me that Sir Kenelme Digby did translate
Petronius Arbiter into English.


_Notes._

[DU] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'azure, a fleur de lys argent
[Digby]; impaling, argent on a bend azure 3 bucks' heads caboshed or
[Stanley]'; and adds the reference 'vide his life in ...' some book,
presumably, whose title he had forgot.

[DV] 'June' was written; but Aubrey noted in the margin 'Quaere Mr.
Ashmole pro nativitate by Dr. <Richard> Nepier.' The answer to this
query is found in MS. Aubr. 23, a slip at fol. 121ᵛ, 'Sir Kenelm Digby
natus July 11, 5ʰ 40´ A.M. 1603; another scheme gives it at 4ʰ A.M.'
Having got this information, Aubrey then struck out 'June' in the text,
and substituted 'July'; and added the paragraph which follows.




=Venetia Digby= (1600-1633).


[860]Venetia Stanley[DW] was daughter of Sir ... Stanley.

She was a most beautifull desireable creature; and being _matura
viro_ was left by her father to live with a tenant and servants
at Enston-abbey[LXVIII.] (his land, or the earl of Derby's) in
Oxfordshire; but as private as that place was, it seemes her beautie
could not lye hid. The young eagles had espied her, and she was
sanguine and tractable, and of much suavity (which to abuse was greate
pittie).

[LXVIII.] At the west end of the church here[DX] were two towers as at
Welles or Westminster Abbey, which were standing till about 1656. The
romes of the abbey were richly wainscotted, both sides and roofe.

In those dayes Richard, earle of Dorset (eldest son[861] and heire to
the Lord Treasurer, vide pedegree) lived in the greatest splendor of
any nobleman of England. Among other pleasures that he enjoyed, Venus
was not the least. [LXIX.]This pretty creature's fame quickly came to
his Lordship's eares, who made no delay to catch at such an opportunity.

[LXIX.] Sam. Daniel:--Cheekes of Roses, locks of amber | To b'emprisond
in a chamber | etc.

I have now forgott who first brought her to towne, but I have heard
my uncle Danvers[862] say (who was her contemporary) that she was so
commonly courted, and that by grandees, that 'twas written over her
lodging one night _in literis uncialibus_,

                          PRAY COME NOT NEER,
                 FOR DAME VENETIA STANLEY LODGETH HERE.

The earle of Dorset, aforesayd, was her greatest gallant, who was
extremely enamoured of her, and had[863] one if not more children by
her. He setled on her an annuity of 500 _li._ per annum.

Among other young sparkes of that time, Sir Kenelme Digby grew
acquainted with her, and fell so much in love with her that he
married her, much against the good will of his mother; but he would
say that 'a wise man, and lusty, could make an honest woman out of a
brothell-house.' Sir Edmund Wyld had her picture[LXX.] (and you may
imagine was very familiar with her), which picture is now (vide) at
Droitwytch, in Worcestershire, at an inne, where now the towne keepe
their meetings. Also at Mr. Rose's, a jeweller in Henrietta-street in
Convent garden, is an excellent piece of hers, drawne after she was
newly dead.

[LXX.] Venetia Stanley:--her picture is at the earl of Rutland's at
Belvoir.--From my cosen Montague.--MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 25.

She had a most lovely and sweet-turn'd face, delicate darke-browne
haire. She had a perfect healthy constitution; strong; good skin;
well proportioned; much enclining to a _Bona Roba_ (near altogether).
Her face, a short ovall; darke-browne eie-browe, about which much
sweetness, as also in the opening of her eie-lidds. The colour of her
cheekes was just that of the damaske rose, which is neither too hott
nor too pale. She was of a just[864] stature, not very tall.

Sir Kenelme had severall pictures of her by Vandyke, &c.[LXXI.] He
had her hands cast in playster, and her feet, and her face. See Ben:
Johnson's 2d volumne, where he hath made her live in poetrey, in his
drawing of her both body and mind:--

[LXXI.] Her picture by Vandyke is now at Abermarleys, in
Carmarthenshire, at Mr. Cornwalleys' sonne's widowe's (the lady
Cornwalleys's) howse, who was the daughter and heire of ... Jones, of
Abermarles.

    'Sitting, and ready to be drawne,
    What makes these tiffany, silkes, and lawne,
    Embroideries, feathers, fringes, lace,
    When every limbe takes like a face!'--&c.

[865]When these verses were made she had three children by Sir Kenelme,
who are there mentioned, viz. Kenelme, George, and John.

She dyed in her bed suddenly. Some suspected that she was poysoned.
When her head[866] was opened there was found but little braine, which
her husband imputed to her drinking of viper-wine; but spitefull
woemen would say 'twas a viper-husband who was jealous of her that she
would steale a leape. I have heard some say,--e.g. my cosen Elizabeth
Falkner,--that after her mariage she redeemed her honour by her
strick't living. Once a yeare the earle of Dorset invited her and Sir
Kenelme to dinner, where the earle would behold her with much passion,
and only kisse her hand.

[Illustration]

Sir Kenelme erected to her memorie a sumptuouse and stately
monument[867] at ... Fryars[868] (neer Newgate-street) in the east end
of the south aisle, where her bodie lyes in a vault of brick-worke,
over which are three steps[869] of black marble, on which was a
stately altar of black marble with 4 inscriptions in copper gilt
affixed to it: upon this altar her bust of copper gilt, all which
(unlesse the vault, which was onely opened a little by the fall) is
utterly destroyed by the great conflagration. Among the monuments in
the booke mentioned in Sir Kenelm Digby's life, is to be seen a curious
draught of this monument, with copies of the severall inscriptions.

About 1676 or 5, as I was walking through Newgate-street, I sawe Dame
Venetia's bust standing at a stall at the Golden Crosse, a brasier's
shop. I perfectly remembred it, but the fire had gott-off the guilding:
but taking notice of it to one that was with me, I could never see
it afterwards exposed to the street. They melted it downe. How these
curiosities would be quite forgott, did not such idle fellowes as I am
putt them downe!

Memorandum:--at Goathurst, in Bucks[870], is a rare originall picture
of Sir Kenelme Digby and his lady Venetia, in one piece, by the hand of
Sir Anthony van Dyke. In Ben. Johnson's 2d volumne is a poeme called
'Eupheme[DY], left to posteritie, of the noble lady, the ladie Venetia
Digby, late wife of Sir Kenelme Digby, knight, a gentleman absolute
in all numbers: consisting of these ten pieces, viz. Dedication of
her Cradle; Song of her Descent; Picture of her Bodie; Picture of her
Mind; Her being chose a Muse; Her faire Offices; Her happy Match;
Her hopefull Issue; Her ἈΠΟΘΕΩΣΙΣ, or Relation to the Saints; Her
Inscription, or Crowne.'

Her picture drawn by Sir Anthony Vandyke hangs in the queene's
draweing-roome, at Windsor-castle, over the chimney.

Venetia Stanley was (first) a miss to Sir Edmund Wyld; who had her
picture, which after his death, serjeant Wyld (his executor) had;
and since the serjeant's death hangs now in an entertayning-roome at
Droitwich in Worcestershire. The serjeant lived at Droitwich.


_Notes._

[DW] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'argent on a bend azure 3 bucks'
heads caboshed or [Stanley, earl of Derby].' Another hand has enlarged
this first sentence to 'daughter of Sir Edward Stanley of Eynstonn in
com. Oxon, son of Sir Thomas Stanley, knight, younger son to Edward,
earl of Derby.' A note by 'E. M.' (? Edmund Malone) says, 'This is
Anthony Wood's handwriting.' It is certainly not; but it very probably
is Sir William Dugdale's, which is sometimes mistaken for Wood's.

[DX] Einsham abbey is the place meant. See the facsimile in Clark's
Wood's _Life and Times_, i. 228.

[DY] In MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 70ᵛ also, this is quoted, but there scored
out, as 'Eupheme, being a poem left to posterity,' &c. There, for 'a
Muse,' Aubrey reads 'his Muse.'

[873]Memorandum this visitation[874] was in anno 1619 by John Philpot.

They[875] were, for severall generations, of Barham in Kent. John, the
sonne of Roger Digges of Mildenhall (which Roger is the first in this
genealogie), vixit tempore Henrici III; and writt then Dig.--Memorandum
here are 14 generations or descents to the last line: quod N. B.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mr. Leonard Digges translated Claudian _de raptu Proserpinae_ into
English, 4to, 1617 and 1628.

[876]Leonard Digges, esquire, of Wotton[EA] in Kent--he wrote a thin
folio called _Pantometria_, printed 15.. At the end he discourses of
regular solids, and I have heard the learned Dr. John Pell say it is
donne admirably well. In the preface he speakes of cutting glasses in
such a particular manner that he could discerne pieces of money a mile
off; and this he saies he setts downe the rather because severall are
yet living that have seen him doe it.

... Prognostication[EB] everlasting, 4to, <Lond.> 15<64>.

(A 4to) '_Tectonicon_, briefly shewing the exact measuring and speedy
reckoning all manner of land, squares, timber, stone, steeples,
pillars, globes, etc., for declaring the perfect making and large
use of the carpenter's ruler, containing a quadrant geometricall,
comprehending also the rare use of the square, and in the end a little
treatise opening the composition and appliancie of an instrument called
The Profitable Staffe, with other things pleasant and necessarie, most
condusible for surveyors, landmeaters, joyners, carpenters, and masons:
published by Leonard Digges, gentleman, 1556.'

'L. D. to the Reader--Although many have put forth sufficient and
certain rules to measure all manner of superficies, etc., yet in that
the art of numbring hath been required, yea, chiefly those rules hid
and as it were locked up in strange tongues, they doe profit or have
furthered very little, for the most part, yea, nothing at all, the
landmeater, carpenter, mason, wanting the aforesayd. For their sakes I
am here provoked not to hide but to open the talent I have recieved,
yea, to publish in this our tongue very shortly if God give life a
volumne containing the flowers of the sciences mathematicall largely
applied to our outward practise profitably pleasant to all manner men.
Here mine advice shall be to those artificers, that will profit in this
or any of my bookes ☞ now published, or that hereafter shall be, first
confusedly to read them through, then with more judgement, read at the
third reading wittily to practise. So, few things shall be unknowne.
Note, oft diligent reading joyned with ingenious practise causeth
profitable labour. Thus most hartely farewell, loving reader, to whom I
wish myselfe present to further thy desire and practise in these.'

The method that carpenters etc. used before this booke was published
was very erronious, as he declares.

[877]☞ See in the beginning of <Thomas> Digges' _Stratio<ti>cos_, and
also towards the later end, concerning him and his father. I remember
the sonne sayes there that he was muster-master to the States of
Holland: and see more concerning his father (who was an esquire of
Chilham Castle in Kent) in the preface to his _Pantometria_.--It is an
ancient family in Kent. Vide his _Ala seu scala Mathematices_ etc.

[878]A prognostication everlasting, once again published by Leonard
Digges, gentleman, in the yeare of our Lord 1564;--

in 4to, dedicated to Sir Edward Fines, knight of the garter, lord
Clinton and Saye, etc. His first impression was in 1553--'not onely
your lordship's tasck move<d> of a prognostication seemed then to make
that argument fittest, but also the manifest imperfections and manifold
errors yearly committed did crave the ayd of some that were both
willing and able to performe the truthe in like matters.'


_Notes._

[DZ] In MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 73ᵛ, Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'gules,
on a cross argent five eagles displayed sable [Digges]'; on fol. 72ᵛ,
75ᵛ, he gives the same coat, with the motto

                            IN ARDUA VIRTUS;

on fol. 11, he gives the coat and motto, but adds that there is a
crescent 'in medio scuti.'

[EA] 'Wotton' is substituted for '... Castle,' to which a marginal
note was added, 'I think 'tis Chilham Castle.' In MS. Aubr. 8, fol.
11, Aubrey wrote:--'... Digges, esq., of Chilham Castle, Kent--vide
prefaces of his _Pantometrie_ and _Ala seu Scala Mathematices_, etc.
His son makes mention of his life in his _Stratioticos_.'

[EB] A pencil note on fol. 73 gives the title, with the press mark
in the 1674 _Catal. libr. impress. Bibl. Bodl._, viz.--'A perpetual
prognostication for weather: C. 2. 13. Art.'




=Thomas Digges= (15..-1595).


[879]Mr. Thomas Digges:--he wrote a booke in 4to, entituled--

'_Stratioticos_, compendiously teaching the science of nombres as well
in fractions as integers, and so much of the rules and aequations
algebraicall and art of nombers cossicall as are requisite for the
profession of a soldier; together with the modern militarie discipline,
offices, lawes and orders in every well-governed camp and armie
inviolably to be observed.'

First published by him, 1579, and dedicated 'unto the right honourable
Robert, earle of Leicester.' The second edition, 1590.

He was muster-master generall of all her majestie's forces in the Low
Countries, as appeares in page 237.

At the end of this booke (the last paragraph) speaking of 'engins and
inventions not usual to be thought on and had in readinesse.'--

'Of these and many mo important mattars militare, I shall have occasion
at large to dilate in my treatise of great artillerie and pyrotechnie,
☞ whose publication I have for divers due respects hitherto differred.'

He was the onely sonne of the learned Leonard Digges, esqr, of whom he
speakes in the preface to his _Stratioticos_.

Pliny, Nat. Hist. lib. vii. cap. 51;--'Una familia Curionum in qua
tres continua serie Oratores extiterunt.' In _this_ family have been
four learned men in an uninterrupted descent--scilicet, two eminent
mathematicians (Leonard and Thomas), Sir Dudley Digges, Master of the
Rolles, and his sonne Dudley, fellow of Allsoules College, Oxon.

sonne Thomas Digges esqr. and dedicated to Sir Nicholas Bacon, knight,
Lord Keeper, lately reviewed and augmented by the author, printed at
London, 1591.

In the preface, thus:--

'But to leave things doone of antiquity long ago, my father, by
his continuall painfull practises, assisted with demonstrations
mathematicall, was able, and sundry times hath, by proportionall
glasses duely situate in convenient angles, not onely discovered things
farre off, read letters, numbred peeces of money with the very coyne
and superscription thereof cast by some of his freends on purpose upon
downes in open fields but also seven miles off declared what hath been
doone at that instant in private places; he hath also at sundry times
by the sunne fired powder and discharged ordinance halfe a mile and
more distant--which things I am the bolder to report for that there
are yet living diverse of these his doeings _oculati testes_, and many
other matters far more strange and rare which I omit as impertinent to
this place. But for invention of these conclusions I have heard him say
nothing ever helped him so much as the exquisite knowledge he had, by
continuall practise, attained in geometricall mensurations.'




=Michael Drayton= (1563-1631).


[883]Michael Drayton, esq., natus in Warwickshire at Atherston upon
Stower (quaere Thomas Mariett).

He was a butcher's sonne. Was a squire; viz. one of the esquires to Sir
Walter Aston, Knight of the Bath, to whom he dedicated his Poeme. Sir
J. Brawne of ... was a great patron of his.

He lived at the bay-windowe house next the east end of St. Dunstan's
Church in Fleet-street. Sepult. in north + of Westminster Abbey.
The countesse of Dorset[884] (Clifford) gave his monument: this Mr.
Marshall (the stone-cutter), who made it, told me so.

Sir Edward Bissh, Clarencieux, told me he asked Mr. Selden once
(jestingly) whether he wrote the commentary to his 'Polyolbion' and
'Epistles,' or Mr. Drayton made those verses to his notes.

Vide his inscription given by the countess of Dorset.


_In Westminster Abbey, neer Spencer._

                       MICHAEL DRAYTON, ESQUIER,

[Sidenote: A MERCURIE'S CAP IN THE SUN[885].]

[Sidenote: A PEGASUS[885].]

    A memorable Poet of this age, exchanged his Laurel for
              a Crowne of Glorie, Anno 1631.
          Doe, pious marble, let thy readers knowe
          What they, and what their children owe
          To DRAYTON'S name, whose sacred dust
          We recommend unto thy trust.
          Protecte his mem'ry, and preserve his storie,
          Remaine a lasting monument of his glorye.
          And when thy ruines shall disclame
          To be the treas'rer of his name,
          His name, that cannot fade, shall bee
          An everlasting monument to thee.

Here is his bust in alablaster. The inscription is on black marble.

Mr. Marshall, the stone-cutter, of Fetter-lane, also told me, that
these verses were made by Mr. Francis Quarles, who was his great
friend, and whose head he wrought curiously in playster, and valued for
his sake. 'Tis pitty it should be lost. Mr. Quarles was a very good man.




=Sir Erasmus Dryden= (1553-1632).


[886]Sir Erasmus Dryden, of <Canons Ashby> in Northamptonshire:--John
Dreyden, esq., Poet Laureat, tells me that there was a great friendship
between his great grandfather's father[887] and Erasmus Roterodamus,
and Erasmus was god-father to one of his sonnes, and the Christian name
of Erasmus hath been kept in the family ever since. The poet's second
sonne is Erasmus.

And at ..., the seate of the family, is a chamber called 'Erasmus's
chamber.'

I ghesse that this coate[888]--'azure, a lion rampant and in chief a
sphere between 2 estoiles or'--was graunted in Henry 8th's time by the
odnesse of the charge.




=John Dryden= (1631-1700).


[889]John Dreyden, esq., Poet Laureate. He will write it[890] for me
himselfe.

[891]John Dryden, poeta, <born> 19 Aug. 1631, 5ʰ 33´ 16˝ P.M.

                      [892]'Natus insignis poeta

                          Latit. 52° North.'

This is the nativity of Mr. John Dreyden, poet laureat, by Mr. John
Gadbury, from whom I had it.




=Sir William Dugdale= (1605-1685/6).


[893]Sir William Dugdale, Garter, <born> 12 Sept. 1605, 3ʰ 15´ P.M.

[894]'Sir[EC] William Dugdale avow'd to mee <that> at the time of his
birth (10 September, as I thinke, which was the birth day of Francis
the first) a swarme of bees came and settled under the window where hee
was borne, September 18. Johan. Gybbon.'

Memorandum that Sir William Dugdale did not tell his son or Mr. Gibbons
de Edward the Confessor and he laught at it--quod N. B.

'Sir[ED] William Dugdale was borne September 12, 1605'--from Mr.
Gibbons, Blewmantle. That afternoon a swarme of bees pitch't under
his mother's chamber window, as it were an omen of his laborious
collections.


_Notes._

[EC] This is a note in the handwriting of John Gibbon ('Blue Mantle'
pursuivant, 1668); followed by a memorandum by Aubrey.

[ED] A note by Gibbon, correcting the previous one: followed by a
memorandum by Aubrey.




=Sir John Dunstable.=


[895]Sir John Dunstable:--the cellar he calls his library.--Parliament
men prepare themselves for the businesse of the nation with ale in the
morning. Some justices doe sleepe on the bench every assizes.

[896]At Chippenham the Deputye Lieutenants mett to see the order of the
militia, but quales D: Lieutenants tales officiarii. After a taedious
setting (at dinner, and drinking after dinner) the drummes beate and
the soldiers to march before the windowe to be seen by the Deputy
Lieutenants. Justice Wagstaffe[EE] (colonell) had not marcht before 'em
many yardes but downe a falls all along in the dirt. His myrmidons,
multâ vi, heav'd him up, and then a cryd out 'Some drinke, ho!' and so
there was an end of that businesse.


_Note._

[EE] The hero of the anecdote is no doubt Sir John Dunstable. In
the _Dramatis personae_ for Aubrey's projected comedy, one of the
characters is 'Justice Wagstaffe' (MS. Aubr. 21, p. 2), over which name
Aubrey has written 'Sir J. Dunstable,' apparently as the name of the
person he meant to copy.




=Saint Dunstan= (925-988).


[897]I find in Mr. Selden's verses before Hopton's 'Concordance of
Yeares,' that he was a Somersetshire gentleman. He was a great chymist.

The storie of his pulling the devill by the nose with his tongues as he
was in his laboratorie[898], was[899] famous in church-windowes. Vide
... Gazaei _Pia Hilaria_, <where it is> delicately described.

He was a Benedictine monke at Glastonbury, where he was afterwards
abbot, and after that was made archbishop of Canterbury. He preached
the coronation sermon at Kingston, and crowned king <Edwy>. In his
sermon he prophesyed, which the Chronicle mentions.

Mr. Meredith Lloyd tells me that there is a booke in print of his de
lapide philosophorum; quaere nomen.

Edwardus Generosus gives a good account of him in a manuscript which
Mr. Ashmole haz.

Meredith Lloyd had, about the beginning of the civill warres, a MS. of
this Saint's concerning chymistrey, and sayes that there are severall
MSS. of his up and downe in England: quaere Mr. Ashmole.

Edwardus Generosus mentions that he could make a fire out of gold, with
which he could sett any combustible matter on fire at a great distance.
Memorandum:--in Westminster library is an old printed booke, in folio,
of the lives of the old English Saints: vide.

Meredith Lloyd tells me that, three or 400 yeares ago, chymistry was
in a greater perfection, much, then now; their proces was then more
seraphique and universall: now they looke only after medicines.

Severall churches are dedicated to him: two at London: quaere if one at
Glastonbury.




=Sir Edward Dyer= (15..-1607).


[900]Sir Edward Dyer, of Somersetshire (Sharpham Parke, etc.), was a
great witt, poet, and acquaintance of Mary, countesse of Pembroke, and
Sir Philip Sydney. He is mentioned in the preface of the 'Arcadia.' He
had four thousand pounds per annum, and was left fourscore thousand
pounds in money; he wasted it almost all. This I had from captaine
Dyer, his great grandsonne, or brother's great grandson. I thought he
had been the sonne of the Lord Chiefe Justice Dyer, as I have inserted
in one of these papers, but that was a mistake. The judge was of the
same family, the captain tells me.




=St. Edmund= (1170?-1240).


[901]Seth, lord bishop of Sarum, tells me that he finds Saint Edmund
was borne at Abington. He was archbishop of Canterbury. He built the
college at Sarum, by St. Edmund's Church: it is now Judge Wyndham's
sonne's howse. He resigned his archbishoprick, and came and retired
hither. In St. Edmund's church here[902], were windowes of great value.
Gundamore[903] offered a good summe for them; I have forgott <what>. In
one of them was the picture of God the Father, like an old man (as the
fashion was), which much offended Mr. Shervill, the recorder, who in
zeale (but without knowledge) clambered up on the pewes[904] to breake
the windowe, and fell downe and brake his legg (about 1629); but that
did not excuse him for being question'd in the Starre-chamber for it.
Mr. Attorney Noy was his great friend, and shewed his friendship there.
But what Mr. Shervill left undonne, the soldiers since have gonne
through with, that there is not a piece of glass-painting left.

'Edmundus, Cant.[905] A.B., primus legit Elementa Euclidis, Oxoniæ,
1290[906]; Mr. Hugo perlegit librum Aristotelis Analytic. Oxon.;
Rogerus Bacon vixit A.D. 1292.'--This out of an old booke in the
library of University College, Oxon.




=Thomas Egerton=, lord Ellesmere (1540-1616/7).


[907]Sir Thomas Egerton[EF], Lord Chancellor, was the naturall sonne of
Sir Richard Egerton of <Ridley> in Cheshire.--This information I had 30
yeares since from Sir John Egerton of Egerton in Cheshire, baronet, the
chiefe of that family.

He was of Lincoln's-Inne, and I have heard Sir John Danvers say that
he was so hard a student, that in three or 4 yeares time he was not out
of the howse. He had good parts, and early came into good practise.

My old father, Colonel Sharington Talbot[LXXII.], told me that
(Gilbert, I thinke), earle of Shrewesbury, desired him to buy that
noble mannour of Ellesmer for him, and delivered him the money. Egerton
liked the bargain and the seate so well, that truly he e'en kept it for
himselfe, and afterwards made it his baronry, but the money he restored
to the earl of Shrewsbury again[908].

[LXXII.] He had, I believe, 200 adopted sonnes.

Dyed ..., and was buried....

He was a great patron to Ben Johnson, as appeares by severall epistles
to him.

His son and heire, since earle of Bridgewater, was an indefatigable
ringer--vide the ballad.

[909]Chancellor Egerton haz a monument in the south wall of St.
Martin's-in-the-fields chancell; but the upper part (greatest) is
covered with a pue or gallerie.

    Tuta[910] frequensque via est, per amici fallere nomen;
      Tuta frequensque licet sit via, crimen habet.

                                       OVID <Ars Amat. i. 585>.

Translated by Theophilus Wodinoth:--

    A safe and common way it is by friendship to decieve,
    But safe and common though it be, 'tis knavery, by your leave.


_Note._

[EF] Aubrey gives in colours the coat:--'argent, a lion rampant gules
between 3 pheons sable [Egerton].'




=George Ent= (16..-1679).


[911]G. Ent[912] obiit Septemb. 2, 1679. Buried in the north of the
rotundo at the Temple Church. Motto of his ring:--

                   Quam totus homuncio nil est[913].


_Note._

In August, 1674, this George Ent came to Oxford, to live there. He
brought with him a letter of introduction from Aubrey to Anthony
Wood, which is now in MS. Ballard 14. Wood and he did not get on,
and Aubrey several times makes excuses for his friend; e.g. Aug. 26,
1674 (MS. Ballard 14, fol. 110), 'he is a very honest gentleman and
his rhodomontades you will easily pardon.' The quarrels, however,
became fiercer. Aubrey to Wood, March 9, 1674/5, (MS. Ballard 14, fol.
115):--'I am exceeding sorry for Mr. Ent's strangenesse to you; but
'tis confess't his friends must beare with him. I did not shew him your
letter; but, expostulating with him, and he being cholerique, etc., I
read only that paragraph where he "introduced into your company two
boy-bachelors and upbrayded you with dotage"--.'




=Desiderius Erasmus= (1467-1536).


[914]'Nascitur Erasmus Roterodamus anno 1467, Octob. die 27, horâ 16,
30´: poli elevatio 54° 0´'--<from> David Origanus, p. 603.

'Mercurius, Venus, Luna et Leo conjuncti, praesertim in ascendente,
faciunt oratores doctissimos. Talis ex parte fuit constitutio Erasmi
Roterodami, cujus judicium gravissimum, ingenium acutissimum, et oratio
copiosissima, ex scriptis editis eruditissimis, omnibus nota est.
Habuit enim Mercurium cum Venere in horoscopo, in signo aereo Libram,
et Jovem trigono radio Mercurium et Venerem intuentem'--<from ibid.>
pag. 601.

Obiit anno Domini MDXXXVI, mense Julii--vide praefationem de obitu
Erasmi ante Epistolas, impressas Antverpiae MDXLV.

[915]Erasmus Roterodamus was like to have been a bishop--vide Epistolas.

[916]Desiderius Erasmus, Roterodamus:--

His name was 'Gerard Gerard,' which he translated into 'Desiderius
Erasmus.'

He was _begot_ (as they say) _behind dores_--vide an Italian booke
in 8vo. _de famosi Bastardi_: vide Anton. Possevini _Apparatus_. His
father (as he says in his life, writt by himselfe) was the tenth and
youngest son of his grandfather: who was therfore designed to be
dedicated to God.--'Pater Gerardus cum Margareta (medici cujusdam
Petri filia), spe conjugii (et sunt qui intercessisse verba dicunt),
vixit.'

His father tooke great care to send him to an excellent schoole, which
was at Dusseldorf, in Cleveland. He was a tender chitt, and his mother
would not entruste him at board[917], but tooke a house there, and made
him cordialls, etc.--from John Pell, D.D.

He loved not fish, though borne in a fish towne--from Sir George Ent,
M.D.

<From> Dr. John Pell:--he was of the order of ..., whose habit was the
same that the pest-house master at ... (I thinke, Pisa: quaere Dr. John
Pell) in Italie wore; and walking in that towne, people beckoned him to
goe out of the way, taking him to be the master of the pest-house; and
he not understanding the meaning, and keeping on his way, was there by
one well basted. He made his complaint when he came to Rome, and had a
dispensation for his habit.

He studied sometime in Queens Colledge in Cambridge: his chamber was
over the water. Quaere Mr. Paschal more particularly; and if a fellowe:
he[918] had his study when a young scholar here.

'The staires which rise up to his studie at Queens Colledge in
Cambridge doe bring first into two of the fairest chambers in the
ancient building; in one of them, which lookes into the hall and chiefe
court, the Vice-President kept in my time; in that adjoyning, it was my
fortune to be, when fellow. The chambers over are good lodgeing roomes;
and to one of them is a square turret adjoyning, in the upper part of
which is that study of Erasmus; and over it leades. To that belongs
the best prospect about the colledge, viz. upon the river, into the
corne-fields, and countrey adjoyning, etc.; ☞ so that it might very
well consist with the civility of the House to that great man (who
was no fellow, and I think stayed not long there) to let him have that
study. His keeping roome might be either the Vice-President's, or, to
be neer to him, the next; the room for his servitor that above, over
it, and through it he might goe to that studie, which for the height,
and neatnesse, and prospect, might easily take his phancy.' This from
Mr. Andrew Paschal, Rector of Chedzoy in Somerset, June 15, 1680.

He mentions his being there in one of his Epistles, and blames the
beere there. One, long since, wrote, in the margent of the booke
in <the> College library in which that is sayd, '_Sicut erat in
principio_, etc.'; and all Mr. Paschall's time they found fault with
the brewer.

He had the parsonage (quaere value) of Aldington in Kent, which is
about 3 degrees perhaps a healthier place then Dr. Pell's parsonage in
Essex. I wonder they could not find for him[919] better preferment; but
I see that the Sun and Aries being in the second house[920], he was not
borne to be a rich man.

He built a schoole at Roterdam, and endowed it, and ordered the
institution[921]. Sir George Ent was educated there. A statue in brasse
is erected to his memory on the bridge in Roterdam.

'The last five bookes of Livy nowe extant, found by Symon Grinaeus
in the library of a monastery over against the citie of Wormbs, are
dedicated by Erasmus Roterodamus unto Charles the son of William lord
Montjoy in the reigne of Henry the eight of famous memory, king of
England, etc.'--Philemon Holland's translation.

Sir Charles Blount, of Maple-Durham, in com. Oxon. (neer Reding),
was his scholar (in his Epistles there are some to him), and desired
Erasmus to doe him the favour[922] to sitt for his picture, and he did
so, and it is an excellent piece: which picture my cosen John Danvers,
of Baynton (Wilts), haz: his wive's grandmother was Sir Charles
Blount's daughter or grand-daughter. 'Twas pitty such a rarity should
have been aliend from the family, but the issue male is lately extinct.
I will sometime or other endeavour to gett it for Oxford Library.

They were wont to say that Erasmus was interpendent between Heaven and
Hell, till, about the year 1655 (quaere Dr. Pell), the Conclave at Rome
damned him for a heretique, after he had been dead ... yeares.

Vita Erasmi, Erasmo autore, is before his Colloquia, printed at
Amstelodam. MDCXLIV. But there is a good account of his life, and also
of his death, scil. at Basil, and where buried, before his Colloquies
printed at London.

His deepest divinity is where a man would least expect it: viz. in his
Colloquies in a Dialogue between a Butcher and a Fishmonger, Ἰχθυοφαγία.


_Scripsit._

Colloquia: dedicated 'optimae spei puero Johanni Erasmio Frobenio.'

Liber utilissimus de conscribendis epistolis: dedicated 'ad Nicolaum
Beraldum.'

Liber Adagiorum.

    Joan.--dedicated Ferdinando, Catholico.

    Lucas--to Henr. 8, Rex Angl.

    Marcus--to Francisc. I, Gall. Rex.

Novum Testamentum transtulit: memorandum--Henry Standish, bishop of St.
Asaph, wrote a booke against his Translation on the New Testament; vide
Sir Richard Baker's _Chronicle_ (Henry VIII).

If my memorie failes me not, I have read in the first edition of Sir
Richard Baker's _Chronicle_ (quaere) that the Syntaxis in our English
Grammar was writt by Erasmus.

Memorandum:--Julius Scaliger contested with Erasmus, but gott nothing
by it, for, as Fuller sayth, he was like a badger, that never bitt but
he made his teeth meet. He was the Πρόδρομος of our knowledge, and the
man that made the rough and untrodden wayes smooth and passable[923].




=Anthony Ettrick= (1622-1703).


[924]Anthony Ettrick, esq., borne at Berford in the parish of
Wimburne-Minster com. Dorset, November the 15th (viz. the same day that
Queen Katherine), A.D. 1622--quaere horam--on a Sunday. His mother
would say he was a Sundaye's bird.

His eldest son, Mr. William Ettrick, was borne also on the 15 of
November, A.D. 1651.

Maried Aug. 1651.

Reader at the Middle Temple 167-.




=John Evelyn= (1620-1706).


[925]John Evelyn, esq., Regiae Societatis Socius, drew his first breath
at Wotton in the county of Surrey[EG], A.D. 1620, 31 October, 1ᵐᵃ hora
mane.


_Note._

[EG] In MS. Wood F. 49, fol. 39, is the cover of Aubrey's _Surrey
Collections_:--'An essay towards the description of the county of
Surrey, by Mr. John Aubrey, Fellow of the Royall Societie.' On the back
of this, fol. 39ᵛ, Aubrey has the note:--'Note that the annotations
marked J. E. are of John Evelyn, esq., R.S.S.' These Surrey collections
are now MS. Aubr. 4.




=Thomas Fairfax=, 3rd baron (1611-1671).


[926]Thomas, lord Fairfax of Cameron, Lord Generall of the Parliament
armie:--Memorandum, when Oxford was surrendred[927] (24º Junii
1646), the first thing generall Fairfax did was to sett a good guard
of soldiers to preserve the Bodleian Library. 'Tis said there was
more hurt donne by the cavaliers (during their garrison) by way of
embezilling and cutting-off chaines of bookes, then there was since.
He was a lover of learning, and had he not taken this speciall care,
that noble library had been utterly destroyed--quod N. B.; for there
were ignorant senators enough who would have been contented to have had
it so. This I doe assure you from an ocular witnesse, E. W. esq.[928]

He haz a copie of verses before ... in folio.




=George Feriby= (1573-16..).


[929]In tempore Jacobi one Mr. George Ferraby was parson of Bishops
Cannings in Wilts: an excellent musitian, and no ill poet. When queen
Anne came to Bathe, her way lay to traverse the famous Wensdyke,
which runnes through his parish. He made severall of his neighbours
good musitians, to play with him in consort, and to sing. Against
her majestie's comeing, he made a pleasant pastorall, and gave her
an entertaynment with his fellow songsters in shepherds' weeds and
bagpipes, he himself like an old bard. After that wind musique was
over, they sang their pastorall eglogues (which I have, to insert in to
liber B.).

He was one of the king's chaplaines. 'Twas he caused the 8 bells to be
cast there, being a very good ringer.

He hath only one sermon in print that I know of, at the funerall of Mr.
<John> Drew of the Devises, called _Life's Farwell_.

He was demy, if not fellow, of Magdalen College, Oxon.

[930]Thomas[931] Ferraby, formerly a demy or fellow of Magdalen
College, Oxon, minister of Bishops Cannings, Wilts, was an ingeniose
man and a good musitian and composer.

He treated queen Anne at Wednsdytch in his parish with a pastorall
of his owne writing and composing and sung by his neighbours clad in
shepherds' weeds, whom he brought-up to musique.

He gave another entertayment in Cote-field to king James, with carters
singing, with whipps in their hands; and afterwards, a footeball play.

This parish would have challenged all England for musique, ringing, and
footeball play.

He was one of his Majestie's chaplaines. One sermon is among my
grandfather Lyte's old bookes in the country, at the funerall of <John>
Drew, esquire, called _Life's farewell_, printed....




=Nicholas Fiske= (15..-166..).


[932]Dr. ... Fisk[933], a physitian, practised physick and astrologie,
and had good practise in both, in Convent Garden, London. Mr. Gadbury
acknowledges in print to have had his greatest helpes in astrologicall
knowledge from him, and sayes that he was an able artist.

He wrote[934] and printed a treatise of the conjunction of Saturne and
Jupiter.

Obiit about 20 yeares since and buryed in Convent Garden.




=Thomas Flatman= (16..-1688).


[935]Mr. Thomas Flatman, quondam Novi Collegii socius, then a barrister
of the Inner Temple, an excellent painter and poet. The next terme his
poems will be in print.

[936]Mr. Thomas Flatman[EH] died at his house in Fleet street on
Thursday December <6th>, buried the 9th of that moneth, at St. Bride's,
neer the railes of the communion table, in the grave with his sonne, on
whom he layd a fair marble gravestone with an inscription and verses.
His father is living yet, at least 80, a clarke of the Chancery.

[937]Thomas Flatman, filius, natus 1673, Oct. 4, hora 18 P.M. This
native dyed of the small pox about Christmas (December) 1682.


_Note._

[EH] Anthony Wood detects an oversight:--'Why do you not set downe the
yeare?' Aubrey, in MS. Wood F. 39, fol. 386ᵛ, says, 'Thomas Flatman
dyed in 1688, before Christmas.'

Thomas Flattman, of Red Cross street, Aldersgate, London, at Winchester
school from Michaelmas 1648, was admitted probationer of New College
(to an Arts fellowship) 11 Sept. 1654, and fellow in 1656; but resigned
in 1657, betaking himself to the study of Law.




=Sir William Fleetwood= (1535-1594).


[938]Sir Miles[939] Fleetwood, Recorder of London, was of the Middle
Temple; was Recorder of London, when King James came into England; made
his harangue to the City of London (ἀντανάκλασις), 'When I consider
your wealth I doe admire your wisdome, and when I consider your wisdome
I doe admire your wealth.' It was a two-handed rhetorication, but the
citizens tooke <it> in the best sense.

He was a very severe[940] hanger of highwaymen, so that the fraternity
were resolved to make an example of him[941]: which they executed in
this manner: They lay in wayte for him not far from Tyburne, as he was
to come from his house at ... in Bucks; had a halter in readinesse;
brought him under the gallowes, fastned the rope about his neck and
on the tree, his hands tied behind him (and servants bound), and then
left him to the mercy of his horse, which he called _Ball_. So he cryed
'Ho, Ball! Ho, Ball!' and it pleased God that his horse stood still,
till somebody came along, which was halfe a quarter of an hour or +. He
ordered that this horse should be kept as long as he would live, and it
was so--he lived till 1646:--from Mr. Thomas Bigge, of Wicham[942].

One day goeing on foote to Yield-hall, with his clarke behind him, he
was surprised in Cheapside with a sudden and violent looseness neer the
Standard. He[943] ... bade his man hide his face[943]....

His seate was at Missenden in the county of Bucks, where his
descendents still remaine.

He is buried at ... in com. Bucks.




=John Fletcher= (1579-1625).


[944]John Fletcher, invited to goe with a knight into Norfolke or
Suffolke in the plague-time 1625, stayd but to make himselfe a suite of
cloathes; fell sick of the plague, and dyed.

[945]Mr. John Fletcher, poet: in the great plague, 1625, a knight of
Norfolk (or Suffolke) invited him into the countrey. He stayed but to
make himselfe a suite of cloathes, and while it was makeing, fell sick
of the plague and dyed[946]. This I had (1668) from his tayler, who is
now a very old man, and clarke of St. Mary Overy's.




=John Florio= (1545?-1625).


[947]John Florio was borne in London in the beginning of king Edward
VI, his father and mother flying from the Valtolin ('tis about
Piedmont or Savoy) to London for religion: Waldenses.----The family is
originally of Siena, where the name is to this day.

King Edward dying, upon the persecution of queen Mary, they fled back
again into their owne countrey, where he was educated.

Afterwards he came into England, and was by king James made
'informator' to prince Henry for the Italian and French tongues, and
clarke to the closet to queen Anne.

Scripsit:--

First and second fruits, being two books of the instruction to learne
the Italian tongue:

Dictionary;

and translated Montagne's Essayes.

He dyed of the great plague at Fulham anno 1625.




=Sir Edward Ford= (1605-1670).


[948]Edward Ford[949], esquire, printed 5 or 6 sheetes in 4to--Mr.
Edmund Wyld haz it--

'A designe for bringing a river from Rickmansworth in Hartfordshire to
St. Gyles in the fields, the benefits of it declared and the objections
against it answered, by Edward Ford of Harting in Sussex, esq., London,
printed for John Clarke, 1641.' Memorandum that now (1681/2) London is
growne so populous and big that the new river of Middleton can serve
the pipes to private houses but twice a weeke, quod N. B.

I beleeve this was afterwards Sir Edward Ford, quondam a gentleman
commoner of Trinity College, Oxon: de quo vide in prima parte A. W.

Vide in my trunke of papers a printed sheet of his of....

['Twas[950] he built the high water-house over against Somerset howse,
pulled downe since the restauration because a nusance.]

[951]'Experimental proposalls how the king may have money to pay and
maintaine his fleetes with ease to the people, London may be re-built
and all proprietors satisfied, money be lent at 6 _li._ per cent on
pawnes, and the fishing trade sett-up; and all without strayning or
thwarting any of our lawes or customes,' by Sir Edward Forde, London,
printed by W. Godbid, 1666--a 4to pamphlet.

[952]Sir Edward Ford's body was brought over into England, and buried
at Harting Church in Sussex with his ancestors--obiit Sept. 3.

His brother tells me that this August he is 65 years old and that Sir
Edward was borne in Aprill and one yeare and a half older then he.

Sir Edward Ford first proposed his invention, the way of farthings for
this nation, and was opposed. He could not gett a patent here: prince
Rupert would have it, if he could. So then he went into Ireland and
dyed fortnight before he had effected the getting of his patent.

[953]Sir Edward Ford writt no books, but two or three pamphletts of a
sheet or so, which I have some where, and have informed you of. One was
an ingeniose proposall of a publique banke, as I remember, for the easy
raysing of money and to avoyd the griping usurers and to promote trade.




=Samuel Foster= (15..-1652).


[954]From Mr. Bayes, the watchmaker, his nephew:--Mr. Samuel Foster was
borne at Coventry (as I take it); he was sometime usher of the schoole
there. Was professor of ... at Gresham Colledge, London, ... yeares;
where, in his lodgeing, on the wall in his chamber, is, of his owne
hand draweing, the best diall I doe verily beleeve in the whole world.
Inter etc. it shewes you what a clock 'tis at Jerusalem, Gran Cairo,
etc. It is drawen very artificially. He dyed ... July 1652, buryed
at St. Peter's the Poor, in Broad-street, London. A neighbour of Mr.
Paschall's, neer Bridgewater, in Somerset, hath all his MSS.: which I
have seen, I thinke 1/2 foot thick in 4to.




=John Foxe= (1517-1587).


[955]Adjoyning[956] is this inscription[957] of John Fox.

                             Christo S. S.

    Johanni Foxo, ecclesiae Anglicanae martyrologo fidelissimo,

                     Vita vitae mortalis est spes
                           vitae immortalis.





=Nicholas Fuller= (1557-1623/4).


[958]The 13th of February, 1623, Mr. Nicholas Fuller[959], rector of
Allington, was buried--ex registro.




=Thomas Fuller= (1608-1661).


[960]Thomas Fuller, D.D., borne at Orwincle[LXXIII.] in
Northamptonshire. His father was minister there, and maried ..., one
of the sisters of John Davenant, bishop of Sarum.--From Dr. Edward
Davenant.

[LXXIII.] J. Dreyden, poete, was borne here.

He was a boy of a pregnant witt, and when the bishop and his father
were discoursing, he would be by and hearken, and now and then putt in,
and sometimes beyond expectation, or his yeares.

He was of a middle stature; strong sett[961]; curled haire; a very
working head, in so much that, walking and meditating before dinner, he
would eate-up a penny loafe, not knowing that he did it. His naturall
memorie was very great, to which he had added the _art of memorie_: he
would repeate to you forwards and backwards all the signes from Ludgate
to Charing-crosse.

He was fellow of Sydney College in Cambridge, where he wrote his
_Divine Poemes_. He was first minister of Broad Windsor in Dorset, and
prebendary of the church of Sarum. He was sequestred, being a royalist,
and was afterwards minister of Waltham Abbey, and preacher of the
Savoy, where he died, and is buryed.

He was a pleasant facetious person, and a _bonus socius_.

Scripsit 'Holy Warre'; 'Holy State'; 'Pisgah Sight'; 'England's
Worthies'; severall Sermons, among others, a funerall sermon on Henry
Danvers, esq., the eldest son of Sir John Danvers, (and only <son> by
his second wife Dantesey), brother to Henry earl of Danby, preached at
Lavington in Wilts 1654: obiit 19º Novembr.

He was minister of Waltham Crosse in Essex, and also of the Savoy
in the Strand, where he dyed (and lies buryed) not long after the
restauracion of his majestie.




=Simon Furbisher= (1585-16..).


[962]Symon Furbisher, the famous jugler, natus 30 May, 1585, 9ʰ 30´ A.M.




=John Gadbury= (1627-1704).


[963]Mr. Gadbury the astrologer's father, a taylor, takes the measure
of a young lady for a gowne and clappes up a match.


_Note._

Anthony Wood in the _Ath. Oxon._ gives a more correct version of this
story. William Gadbury, a farmer, of Wheatley, co. Oxon, made a stolen
marriage with a daughter of Sir John Curson of Waterperry. Their son,
John Gadbury, was apprentice to an Oxford tailor, before he set up as
an astrologer.

The correspondence between Aubrey and Wood in MS. Wood F. 51, shows
that the publication of this story in Wood's _Athenae_ was, very
naturally, resented by Gadbury. Aubrey to Wood, Aug. 20, 1692, Gadbury
is 'extremely incens't against you: ... he sayes that you have printed
lyes concerning him.' Aubrey to Wood, Oct. 21, 1693, 'I shewed your
letter to Mr. Gadbury, wherin you tell him that what he desires
should be amended as to himselfe shall be donne in the Appendix,'
i.e. the third volume of the _Athenae_, on which Wood was then at
work, 'to be printed: but he huft and pish't, saying that your copies
are flown abroad and the scandalls are irrevocable and that he will
have a fling at you in print to vindicate himselfe.' Wood was blind
to the indiscretion he had committed: Wood to Aubrey, Nov. 1692, MS.
Ballard 14, fol. 153:--'I wonder at nothing more then that Mr. Gadbury
should take it amiss of those things that I say of him: for whereas
the generality of scholars did formerly take him to have been bred an
academian, because he was borne at Oxon, and so, consequently, not
to be much admird, now their eyes being opend and knowing that his
education hath been mechanical they esteem him a prodigie of parts and
therfore are much desirous that his picture may hang in the public
gallery at the schooles.'

=William Gascoigne= (1612?-1644).

[964]There was a most gallant gentleman and excellent mathematician
that dyed[965] in the late warres, one Mr. Gascoigne, of good estate in
Yorkshire; to whom Sir Jonas Moore acknowledged to have received most
of his knowledge. He was bred up by the Jesuites. I thought to have
taken memoires of him; but deferring it, death took away Sir Jonas.
But I will sett downe what I remember.

[966]... Gascoigne, esq., of Middleton, neer Leeds, Yorkshire, was
killed at the battaile of Marston-moore, about the age of 24 or 25 at
most.

Mr. <Richard> Towneley, of Towneley, in Lancashire, esq., haz his
papers.--From Mr. Edmund Flamsted, who sayes he found out the way of
improveing telescopes before Des Cartes.

Mr. Edmund Flamsted tells me, Sept. 1682, that 'twas at Yorke fight he
was slaine.




=Henry Gellibrand= (1597-1637).


[967]Henry Gellibrand was borne in London. He was of Trinity Colledge
in Oxon (vide Anthony Wood's _Antiq. Oxon._). Dr. Potter and Dr.
<William> Hobbes knew him. Dr. Hannibal Potter was his tutor, and
preached his funeral sermon in London. They told me that he was good
for little a great while, till at last it happened accidentally, that
he heard a Geometrie[968] lecture. He was so taken with it, that
immediately he fell to studying it, and quickly made great progresse
in it. The fine diall over the Colledge Library is of his owne doeing.
Construxit Logarithmos Henrici Briggs, jussu Autoris τοῦ μακαρίτου,
1631. He was Astronomy Professor in Collegio Greshamensi, Lond.
Scripsit Trigonometriam. He being one time in the country, shewed the
tricks of drawing[969] what card you touched, which was by combination
with his confederate, who had a string that was tyed to his leg, and
the leg of the other, by which his confederate gave him notice by the
touch; but by this trick, he was reported to be a conjuror.

Vide _Canterbury's Doome_[970] about Protestant martyrs, <inserted in>
the Almanac; <and> that he kept conventicles in Gresham College.




=... Gerard.=


[971]One Mr. Gerard, of Castle Carey in Somerset, collected the
antiquities of that county, Dorset, and that of Devon: which I cannot
for my life retrive. His executor had them, whose estate was seized for
debt; and <they> utterly lost.




=Adrian Gilbert= (---- - ----).


  [972]... Ralegh _m._ Katherine Champernon _m._ ... Gilbert
                   |                         |
         Sir Walter Ralegh             Adrian Gilbert,
                                       chymist; sine prole.

This Adrian Gilbert was an excellent chymist, and a great favourite of
Mary, countesse of Pembroke, with whom he lived and was her operator.
He was a man of great parts, but the greatest buffoon in England; cared
not what he said to man or woman of what quality soever. Some curious
ladies of our country have rare receipts of his. 'Twas he that made the
curious wall about Rollington parke at Wilton.

[973]Mr. Elias Ashmole sayes that amongst his papers of John Dee or Dr.
<Richard> Napier he finds that one of them held great correspondence
with Adrian Gilbert. Quaere of him de hoc.




=Alexander Gill= (1567-1635).

=Alexander Gill= (1597-1642).


[974]Dr. Gill, the father, was a very ingeniose person, as may appeare
by his writings. Notwithstanding he had moodes and humours, as
particularly his whipping-fitts:--

    As Paedants out of the schoole-boies breeches
    doe clawe and curry their owne itches

                                     _Hudibras_, part ... canto ...

This Dr. Gill whipped ... Duncomb, who was not long after a colonel of
dragoons at Edgehill-fight, taken pissing against the wall. He had his
sword by his side, but the boyes surprized him: somebody had throwen a
stone in at the windowe; and they seised on the first man they lighted
on.[975]I thinke his name was _Sir John D_. (Sir John Denham told me
the storie), and he would have cutt the doctor, but he never went
abroad but to church, and then his army went with him. He complained to
the councill, but it became ridicule, and so his revenge sank.

Dr. Triplet came to give his master a visit, and he whip't him. The Dr.
gott ... Pitcher, of Oxford, who had a strong[976] and a sweet base,
to sing this song under the schoole windowes, and gott a good guard to
secure him with swords, etc., and he was preserved from the _examen_
of the little myrmidons which issued-out to attach him; but he was so
frighted that he bes ... him selfe most fearfully.

    In Paul's church-yard in London
    There dwells a noble firker;
    Take heed you that pass
    Lest you tast of his lash
           *       *       *       *       *
        Still doth he cry
        Take him up, take him up, Sir,
        Untrusse with expedition.
            Oh the birchen tool
            That he winds i' th' school
        Frights worse than an inquisition.

    If that you chance to passe there,
    As doth the man of blacking;
    He insults like a puttock
    O're the prey of the buttock
    With a whip't a ... sends him packing.
        Still doth he cry, etc.

    For when this well truss't trounser
    Into the school doth enter
    With his napkin at his nose
    And his orange stuft with cloves
    On any ... he'l venter.
        Still doth, etc.

    A French-man voyd of English
    Enquiring for Paul's steeple
    His _Pardonnez-moy_
    He counted a toy,
    For he whip't him before all people.
        Still doth he cry, etc.

    A Welsh-man once was whip't there
    Untill he did bes... him
    His _Cuds-pluttera-nail_
    Could not prevail
    For he whip't the Cambro-Britan.
        Still doth he cry, etc.

    [977]A captain of the train'd-band;
    Yclept[978] Cornelius Wallis;
    He whip't him so sore
    Both behind and before
    He notch't his .... like tallyes.
        Still doth he cry, etc.

    For a piece of beef and turnip,
    Neglected, with a cabbage,
    He took up the pillion
    Of his bouncing mayd Jillian;
    And sowc't her like a baggage.
        Still doth he cry, etc.

    A porter came in rudely
    And disturb'd the humming concord,
    He took-up his frock
    And he payd his nock
    And sawc't him with his owne cord.
    Still doth he cry, etc.


Gill upon Gill[979], or Gill's ... uncas'd, unstript, unbound.

    'Sir,
      Did _you_ me this epistle send,
      Which is so vile and lewdly pen'd,
      In which no line I can espie
      Of sense or true orthographie?
      So slovenly it goes,
      In verse and prose,
      For which I must pull down your hose.'
        'O good sir!' then cry'd he,
      'In private let it be,
      And doe not sawce me openly.'
        'Yes, sir, I'le sawce you openly
      Before Sound[980] and the company;
      And that none of thee may take heart
      Though thou art a batchelour of Art,
      Though thou hast payd thy fees
      For thy degrees:
      Yet I will make thy ... to sneeze.
      And now I doe begin
      To thresh it on thy skin
      For now my hand is in, is in.
      First, for the themes which thou me sent
      Wherin much nonsense thou didst vent,
      And for that barbarous piece of Greek
      For which in Gartheus[981] thou didst seeke.
      And for thy faults not few,
      In tongue Hebrew,
      For which a grove of birch is due.
      Therfore me not beseech
      To pardon now thy breech
      For I will be thy ...-leech, ...-leech.
        Next for the offense that thou didst give
      When as in Trinity thou didst live,
      And hadst thy ... in Wadham College mult
      For bidding sing _Quicunque vult_[982]
      And for thy blanketting[983]
      And many such a thing
      For which thy name in towne doth ring
      And none deserves so ill
      To heare as bad as Gill--
      Thy name it is a proverb still,
      Thou vented[984] hast such rascall geer.
      Next thou a preacher were.
      For which the French-men all cry Fie!
      To heare such pulpitt-ribauldrie[985].
      And sorry were to see
      So worthy a degree
      So ill bestowed on thee.
      But glad am I to say
      The Masters made the<e> stay
      Till thou in quarto[986] didst them pray.
      But now remaines the vilest thing,
      The alehouse barking 'gainst the king
      And all his brave and noble peeres;
      For which thou ventredst for thy eares.
      And if thou hadst thy right,
      Cutt off they had been quite
      And thou hadst been a rogue in sight.
        But though thou mercy find
      Yet I'le not be so kind
      But I'le jerke thee behind, behind.'




=Joseph Glanville= (1636-1680).


[987]Joseph Glanville, D.D.:--vide his funerall sermon[988] in St.
Paul's church-yard at the signe of....

[989]Dr. Joseph Glanville, minister of Bathe, was taken ill at
Bridgewater, and returned home and dyed, Tuesday, November 9, 1680, and
lies interred in ... at Bath abbey.

He was author of _The zealous and impartiall Protestant_, 4to,
stitch't, printed by Henry Brome, London, 16<81>: his name is not to
it. Had he lived the Parliament would have questioned him for it.




=Owen Glendower= (1359(?)-1415).


[990]Quaere if you can find of what howse the famous Owen Glendower
was. He was of Lincolns Inne, and dyed obscurely (I know where) in this
county <Herefordshire>, keeping of sheepe.

... Skydmore of Kenchurch married his sister, and ... Vaughan of
Hergest was his kinsman; and these two mayntayned him secretly in the
ebbe of his fortune.




=Robert Glover= (1544-1588).


[991]The learned herald, Mr. ... Glover, was borne at ... in
Somersetshire; vide Fuller's 'Worthies' de hoc.

I have heard Sir Wm. Dugdale say, that though Mr. Camden had the name,
yet Mr. Glover was the best herald that did ever belong to the office.
He tooke a great deale of paines in searching the antiquities of
severall counties. He wrote a most delicate hand, and pourtrayed finely.

There is (or late was) at a coffee-house at the upper end of Bell-yard
(or Shier-lane), under his owne hand, a Visitation of Cheshire, a
most curious piece, which Sir Wm. Dugdale wish't me to see; and he
told me that at York, at some ordinary house (I thinke a house of
entertainment) he sawe such an elaborate piece of Yorkshire. But
severall counties he surveyd, and that with great exactnes, but after
his death they were all scattered abroad, and fell into ignorant hands.

He lies interred neer Mr. Foxe's monument (who wrote the
_Martyrologie_) in St. Giles' Cripplegate Chancell, but I could not
find any inscription concerning him. ☞ Quaere the register when he was
buried. 'Twas Mr. John Gibbons[992], Blewmantle, told me he was buried
here. I thinke Mr. Glover was Blewmantle.




=Jonathan Goddard= (1617-1674/5).


[993]Jonathan Godard, M.D., borne at Greenwich (or Rochester, where his
father commonly lived; but, to my best remembrance, he told me at the
former). His father was a ship-carpenter.

He was of Magdalen hall, Oxon. He was one of the College of Physitians,
in London; Warden of Merton College, Oxon, _durante perduellione_;
physitian to Oliver Cromwell, Protector; went with him into Ireland.
Quaere if not also sent to him into Scotland, when he was so
dangerously ill there of a kind of calenture or high fever, which made
him mad that he pistolled one or two of his commanders that came to
visit him in his delirious rage.

Collegii Greshamensis Praelector[994] medicinae; where he lived, and
had his laboratory[995] for Chymistrie. He was an admirable Chymist.

He had three or fower medicines wherwith he did all his cures: a great
ingredient was _Radix Serpentaria_.--From Mr. Mich. Weekes, who looked
to his stills.

He intended to have left his library and papers to the Royall Societie,
had he made his will, and had not dyed so suddainly[996]. So that his
bookes (a good collection) are fallen into the hands of[997] a sister's
son, a scholar in Caius Coll. Camb. But his papers are in the hands
of Sir John Bankes, Reg. Soc. Socius. There were his lectures at
Chirurgions' hall; and two manuscripts in 4to, thicke volumnes, readie
for the presse, one was a kind of Pharmacopœaia (his nephew has this).
'Tis possible his rare universall medicines aforesayd might be retrived
amongst his papers. My Lord Brounker has the recipe but will not impart
it.

He was fellowe of the Royall Societie, and a zealous member for the
improvement of naturall knowledge amongst them. They made him their
drudge, for when any curious experiment was to be donne they would
lay[998] the taske on him.

He loved wine and was most curious in his wines, was hospitable, but
dranke not to excesse, but it happened that comeing from his club at
the Crowne taverne in Bloomesbery, a foote, 11 at night, he fell downe
dead of an apoplexie in Cheapside, at Wood-street end, March 24, Anno
Domini 1674/5, aetat. 56. Sepult. in the church of Great St. Helen,
Londini.




=Sir Edmund Bury Godfrey= (1621-1678).


[999]Sir Edmund-Bury Godfrey was of Christ's Church in Oxon, and
chamber-fellowe to my cosen W<illiam> Morgan of Wells, in Peckwater, in
north-east angle.

He was afterwards of Grayes Inne, and chamber-fellow to my counsell,
Thomas Corbet, esq. I thinke Mr. Corbet told me he was called to the
barre. But by match, or &c. he concieved he should gaine more by
turning _woodmonger_.

The rest of his life and death is _lippis et tonsoribus notum_.

[Knighted[1000] for his great service done in London fire, 1666.]




=Thomas Goodwyn.=


[1001]... Goodwyn: he was borne in Norfolke: of the University of, I
beleeve, Cambridge.

He was ... of the court of Ludlowe (in which place Jack Butts was his
successor).

He maried first Barbara ... daughter of Sir W. Long, of Draycot-Cerne,
in Wilts: 2d, ... Brabazon, of ... Hereffordshire; obiit sine prole.

He was a generall scolar, and had a delicate witt; was a great
historian, and an excellent poet. He wrote, among other things, ...,
a Pastorall, acted at Ludlowe about 1637, an exquisite piece. _The
Journey into France_, crept in bishop Corbet's poems, was made by him,
by the same token it made him misse of the preferment of ... at court,
Mary the queen-mother remembring how he had abused her brother, the
king of France; which made him to accept of the place at Ludlowe, out
of the view of the world.

When he sat in court there, he was wont to have Thuanus, or Tacitus, or
etc. before him. He was as fine a gentleman as any in England, though
now forgott. Obiit, at or about Ludlowe, circiter ... (quaere Sir J. H.
and Sir James Long).

_The Journey into France_ was made by Mr. Thomas Goodwyn, of Ludlowe,
...; certaine.




=Thomas Gore= (1631/2-1684).


[1002]Genesis Thomae Gore armigeri by Charles Snell, esq.:--

'Tuesday, 20ᵐᵒ Martii 1631/2, 11ʰ 00´ P.M. tempus aestimatum geneseos
Thomae Gore, de Alderton <Wilts>, armigeri.'


_Note._

This Thomas Gore, a writer on heraldry, was a correspondent of Anthony
Wood: see Clark's Wood's _Life and Times_, ii. 140, iv. 229. Aubrey
habitually, in his letters to Wood, refers contemptuously to him as
'the cuckold of Alderton.'




=Sir Arthur Gorges= (15..-1625).


[1003]'Sir Arthur Gorges[1004] was buried August the 22ᵗʰ 1661'--_ex
registro Chelsey_.


_In obitum illustrissimi viri Dⁱ. Arthuri Gorges, equitis aurati,
epicedium._

    Te deflent nati, natae, celeberrima conjux;
      Te dolet argutae magna caterva scholae.
    At Lucanus[LXXIV.] ait se vivo non moriturum
      Arthurum Gorges: transtulit ipse decus.
    Aethereas cupiens Arthurus adire per auras
      Et nonus ex ejus nomine natus adest.

[LXXIV.] transtulit Lucanum.

In the aisle of the Gorges, viz. south side of the church of Chelsey
on an altar monument made for his father or grandfather--'Dˢ. Arthur
Gorge, eq. aur., filius ejus natu maximus.'




=John Gower= (1327?-1408).


[1005]John Gower, esq., poet, has a very worshipfull monument in the
north side of the church of St. Saviour's Southwarke; an incumbent
figure: about his head is a chaplet of gold--

meriti, etc.--

and a silver collar of SSS about his neck.

Vide iterum, and also his booke.




=John Graunt= (1620-1674).


[1006]Captaine John Graunt (afterwards, major) was borne (ex MSᵗᵒ
patris sui) 24º die Aprilis, 1/2 an houre before eight a clock on a
Munday morning, the signe being in the 9 degree of Gemini that day at
12 a clock, Anno Domini 1620.

He was the sonne of Henry Graunt, who was borne 18 January 1592[1007],
being Tuesday, at night; et obiit 21 March, 1661/2, being Fryday,
between one and two in the morning; buryed in the vault in the new
vestrie in St. Michaels church in Cornhill. He was borne in ...,
Hantshire.

His son John was borne at the 7 Starres in Burchin Lane, London, in the
parish of St. Michael's Cornhill.

He wrote _Observations on the bills of mortality_ very ingeniosely
(but I beleeve, and partly know, that he had his hint from his
intimate and familiar friend Sir William Petty), to which he made some
_Additions_, since printed. And he intended, had he lived, to have
writt more on the subject.

He writt also some _Observations on the advance of excise_, not
printed: quaere his widowe for them.

To give him his due prayse, he was a very ingeniose and studious
person, and generally beloved, and rose early in the morning to his
study before shop-time. He understood Latin and French. He was a
pleasant facetious companion, and very hospitable.

He was bred-up (as the fashion then was) in the Puritan way; wrote
short-hand dextrously; and after many yeares constant hearing and
writing sermon-notes, he fell to buying and reading of the best
Socinian bookes, and for severall yeares continued of that opinion. At
last, about ..., he turned a Roman Catholique, of which religion he
dyed a great zealot.

He was free of the drapers' company, and by profession was a
haberdasher of small-wares. He had gone through all the offices[1008]
of the city so far as common-councell-man. Captain of the trayned-bands
severall yeares; major, 2 or 3 yeares.--He was a common councell man 2
yeares, and then putt out (as also of his military employment in the
trayned band) for his religion.

He was admitted a fellowe of the Royall Societie, anno 16.. (about
1663).

He broke[1009].... He dyed on Easter eve[1010] 1674; buryed on the
Wednesday in Easter-weeke in St. Dunstan's church in Fleet Strete under
the gallery about the middle (or more west) north side, anno aetatis
suae 54.

He had one son, a man, who dyed in Persia; one daughter, a nunne at ...
(I thinke, Gaunt). His widowe yet alive.

[1011]Major John Graunt dyed on Easter-eve 1674, and was buryed the
Wednesday followeing in St. Dunstan's church in Fleet street in the
body of the said church under the piewes towards the gallery on the
north side, i.e., under the piewes (_alias_ hoggsties) of the north
side of the middle aisle (what pitty 'tis so great an ornament of the
citty should be buryed so obscurely!), aetatis anno 54º.

Was borne in Burchin lane, at the 7 Starres, in St. Michael's Cornhill
parish, at which place he continued his trade till about 2 yeares since.

                                              {1. Political}
  His 'Observations on the bills of mortality {2. . . . . .}'
                                              {3. . . . . .}

hath been printed more then once; and now very scarce.

He wrott some 'Observations on the advance of the excise,' not printed;
and intended to have writt more of the bills of mortality; and also
intended to have written something of religion.

He was by trade a haberdasher of small wares, but was free of the
drapers' company. A man generally beloved; a faythfull friend. Often
chosen for his prudence and justnes to be an arbitrator; and he was
a great peace-maker. He had an excellent working head, and was very
facetious and fluent in his conversation.

[1012]He had gonne thorough all the offices of the city so far as
common councill man. He was common councill man two yeares. Captaine of
the trayned band, severall yeares: major of it, two or three yeares,
and then layd downe trade and all other publique employment for his
religion, being a Roman Catholique.

Ex MSS. patris ejus:--'My son, John Graunt, was borne 24th day of April
halfe an howre before 8 a clock on a Monday morning anno Domini 1620.'

He was my honoured and worthy friend--cujus animae propitietur Deus,
Amen.

His death is lamented by all good men that had the happinesse to knowe
him; and a great number of ingeniose persons attended him to his grave.
Among others, with teares, was that ingeniose great virtuoso, Sir
William Petty, his old and intimate acquaintance, who was sometime a
student at Brase-nose College.




=Edward Greaves= (1608-1680).

=... Gregory.=


[1014]... Gregorie, famous peruq-maker, buryed at St. Clement Danes
church dore west. Quaere inscription in rythme from baron[1015]
Gregory, baron of the exchequer.

Vide Cotgrave's french dictionary ubi peruqes are called Gregorians.

[1016]Peruques not commonly worne till 1660. Memorandum there was one
Gregorie in the Strand that was the first famous periwig-maker; and
they were then called Gregorians (mentioned in Cotgrave's Dictionarie
_in verbo_ perruque). He lies buried by the west church-dore of St.
Clements Danes, where he had an inscription which mentioned it. 'Twas
in verse and Sir William Gregorie (one of the Barons of the Exchequer)
read and told it me. Quaere of him + de hoc.




=Sir Thomas Gresham= (1519-1579).


[1017]Memorandum[EI]:--Mr. Shirman, the attorney, at Inneholders-hall,
hath a copie of Sir Thomas Gresham's will[EJ], which procure.


_Notes._

[EI] Aubrey in MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 8, gives in trick the coats:--(_a_),
'argent, a chevron ermine between 3 mullets pierced sable: crest, a
grasshopper: motto, _Fortun amy_ [Sir Thomas Gresham, 1601]': and
(_b_), 'or, on a bend vert 3 bucks' heads caboshed argent.'

[EJ] Twice alluded to in MS. Aubr. 8, viz., (fol. 8) 'Copie out Sir
Thomas Gresham's will from Mr. Shirman'; (fol. 12) 'Sir Thomas Gresham,
knight: quaere copie of his will from Mr. Shirman, attornie.'




=Fulke Greville=, lord Brooke (1554-1628).

=Robert Greville=, lord Brooke (1607-1642/3).


[1018]Sir Fulke Greville, lord Brokes, adopted a parke-keeper's sonne
his heire, who (I thinke) had but one eie: vide de hoc in Dr. Heylen's
Historie of the church of England ... Vide Sir William Davenant's
life[1019] in part 1ˢᵗ <i.e. in MS. Aubr. 6>.

Poems, in folio, London, printed....

'The life[1020] of the renowned Sir Philip Sidney, with the true
Interest of England, as it then stood in relation to all Forrain
Princes: And particularly for suppressing the power of Spain, stated
by him. Written by Sir Fulke Grevil, knight, lord Brook, a servant to
Queen Elisabeth, and his companion and friend. London, printed for H.
Seile, over against St. Dunstan's church, in Fleet-street, M.DC.LII.'

Vide in Sir William Dugdale's _Warwickshire_ his noble castle[1021],
and monument with this inscription: 'Here lies the body of Sir Fulke
Grevile knight servant to Q. Eliz., counsellor to King James, and
friend to Sir Philip Sidney.'

<Robert Greville, second> lord Brookes, was maried to <Catherine
Russell> daughter of the earle of Bedford. He was killed at the siege
of Lichfield, March the 2d (St. Chad's day, to whom the Church is
dedicated) <1642/3> by a minister's sonne, borne deafe and dumbe, out
of the church. He was armed _cap à pied_; only his bever was open. I
was then at Trinity College in Oxon. and doe perfectly remember the
story.

The lord Brookes, that was killed at Lichfield, printed a booke about
Religion, a little before the civill warres, by the same token that
in[1022] <a> song on the Lords then, his <character> was:--'_Brook is a
foole in print_.'




=Peter Gunning= (1614-1684).


[1023]... Gunning, episcopus Eliensis;--his father was a minister
in the Wild of Kent; and 'tis thought he was borne there, scil. at
Brenchley.




=Edmund Gunter= (1581-1626).


[1024]Mr. Edmund Gunter[EK]:--for his birth, etc., see in _Antiq.
Oxon._ <by> A. Wood.

Captain Ralph Gretorex, mathematical instrument maker in London,
sayd that he was the first that brought mathematicall instruments to
perfection. His booke of the quadrant, sector, and crosse-staffe did
open men's understandings and made young men in love with that studie.
Before, the mathematical sciences were lock't up in the Greeke and
Latin tongues and so[1025] lay untoucht, kept safe in some libraries.
After Mr. Gunter published his booke, these sciences sprang up amain,
more and more to that height it is at now (1690).

When he was a student at Christ Church, it fell to his lott to preach
the Passion sermon, which some old divines that I knew did heare,
but they sayd that 'twas sayd of him then in the University that our
Saviour never suffered so much since his passion as in that sermon, it
was such a lamentable one--

                       Non omnia possumus omnes.

The world is much beholding to him for what he hath donne well.

Gunter is originally a Brecknockshire family, of Tregunter. They came
thither under the conduct of Sir Bernard Newmarch when he made the
conquest of that county (Camden).--'Aubrey, Gunter, Waldbeof, Havard,
Pichard' (which is falsely express'd in all Mr. Camden's bookes, scil.
Prichard, which is non-sense).


_Note._

[EK] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'sable, 3 gauntletts argent'; and
adds 'quaere if these gauntletts are dextre or sinistre?'




=John Guy= (15..-1628).


[1026]Memorandum:--... Guy, alderman of Bristoll, was the wisest man of
his time in that city. He was as their oracle and they chose him for
one of their representatives to sitt in Parliament.

'Twas he that brought in the <bill> for lowering of interest from ten
in the hundred to eight per centum.




=... Gwyn.=


[1027]Surlinesse and inurbanitie too common in England: chastise these
very severely[1028].

A better instance of a squeamish and disobligeing, slighting, insolent,
proud, fellow[1029], perhaps cant be found then in ... Gwin, the
earl of Oxford's[1030] secretary. No reason satisfies him, but he
overweenes, and cutts some sower faces that would turne the milke in a
faire ladie's breast.




=William Habington= (1605-1645).


[1031]William Habington, of Hindlip in Worcestershire, esq., maried
Luce, daughter of William <Herbert>, lord Powes, 1634, as by the
Worcestershire Visitation it appeares.

He was a very learned gentleman, author of a poem called Castara. He
wrote a live of one of the kings of England.


_Note._

Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'argent, on a bend gules 3 eagles
displayed, or; impaling, party per pale argent and gules 3 lions
rampant counterchanged, within a bordure gobony, or and ..., a crescent
for difference.'




=Sir Matthew Hale= (1609-1676).


[1032]_Judge Hale's accidents._

1609, natus, November 1ˢᵗ, in the evening, his father then being at his
prayers.

1612, death of his mother, April 23.

1614, his father dyed, moneth not known.

1625, went to Oxon to Magdalen Hall; vide A. Wood's _History of Oxon_
when matriculated.

1628, admitted of the society of Lincolne's Inne, November 8.

1636, this yeare called to the barre, quaere in what terme.

1640, maried the first time. He was a great cuckold.

1656, his second mariage to his servant mayd, Mary.

1660, made Lord Chief Baron.

1671, Lord Chiefe Justice of England, 18 May.

1676, Christmas day, he dyed.

[1033]Sir Matthew Hales, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, was
borne at Alderley in com. Glouc., November 1ˢᵗ, 1609; christned the
5ᵗʰ. Quaere Mr. Edward Stephens horam, for he has it exactly. When his
mother fell in labour, his father was offering up his evening sacrifice.

[1034]That incomparable man for goodnes and universality of learning,
Sir Matthew Hales, Lord Chief Justice of England, hath writt the
description of Gloucestershire, an elaborate piece, and ready for the
presse. The transcripts of the Tower for it cost him 40 _li._




=John Hales= (1584-1656).


[1035]Mr. John Hales, ...[1036], was borne at Wells, I thinke I have
heard Mr. John Sloper say (vicar of Chalke; his mother was Mr. Hales's
sister, and he bred him at Eaton).

His father was a steward to the family of the Horners:--

    Hopton, Horner, Smyth, and Thynne,
    When abbots went out, they came in[1037].

Went to school, at Bath (as I take it). Fellow of Merton Colledge.
Assisted Sir Henry Savill in his edition of Chrysostome (_cum aliis_).
Afterwards fellow of Eaton College.

Went chaplain to Sir Dudley Carlton (ambassador to ...). I thinke was
at the Synod of Dort.

When the Court was at Windsor, the learned courtiers much delighted
<in> his company, and were wont to grace him with their company.

I have heard his nephew, Mr. Sloper, say, that he much loved to read
... Stephanus, who was a _familist_, I thinke that first wrote of that
sect of the Familie of Love: he was mightily taken with it, and was
wont to say that sometime or other those fine notions would take in the
world. He was one of the first Socinians in England, I thinke the first.

He was a generall scolar, and I beleeve a good poet: for Sir John
Suckling brings him into the Session of the Poets:

    'Little Hales all the time did nothing but smile,
    To see them, about nothing, keepe such a coile.'

He had a noble librarie of bookes, and those judicially chosen, which
cost him ... _li._ (quaere Mr. Sloper); and which he sold to Cornelius
Bee, bookeseller, in Little Britaine, (as I take it, for 1000 _li._)
which was his maintenance after he was ejected out of his fellowship at
Eaton College. He had then only reserved some few for his private use,
to wind-up his last dayes withall.

The ladie Salter (neer Eaton) was very kind to him after the
sequestration; he was very welcome to her ladyship, and spent much of
his time there. At Eaton he lodged (after his sequestration) at the
next house <to> the Christopher (inne), where I sawe him, a prettie
little man, sanguine, of a cheerfull countenance, very gentile, and
courteous; I was recieved by him with much humanity: he was in a kind
of violet-colourd cloath gowne, with buttons and loopes (he wore not a
black gowne), and was reading Thomas à Kempis; it was within a yeare
before he deceased. He loved Canarie; but moderately, to refresh his
spirits.

He had a bountifull mind. I remember in 1647, a little after the
Visitation[1038], when Thomas Mariett, esq., Mr. William Radford, and
Mr. Edward Wood (all of Trinity College) had a frolique from Oxon to
London, on foot, having never been there before, they happened to take
Windsore in their way, made their addresse to this good gentleman,
being then fellow. Mr. Edward Wood was the spookes-man, remonstrated
that they were Oxon scholars: he treated them well, and putt into Mr.
Wood's hands ten shillings.

He lies buried in the church yard at Eaton, under an altar monument of
black marble, erected at the sole chardge of Mr. ... Curwyn, with a too
long epitaph. He was no kiff or kin to him.

[1039]Mr. John Hales dyed at Mris Powney's house, a widow-woman, in
Eaton, opposite to the churchyard, adjoyning to the Christopher Inne
southwards. 'Tis the howse where I sawe him.

She is a very good woman and of a gratefull spirit. She told me that
when she was maried, Mr. Hales was very bountifull to them in helping
them[1040] to live in the world. She was very gratefull to him and
respectfull to him.

She told me that Mr. Hales was the common godfather there, and 'twas
pretty to see, as he walked to Windsor, how his godchildren asked him
blessing[1041]. When he was bursar, he still gave away all his groates
for the acquittances to his godchildren; and by that time he came to
Windsor bridge, he would have never a groate left.

This Mris Powney assures me that the poor were more relieveable, that
is to say, that he recieved more kindnesse from them than from the
rich. That that I putt downe of my lady Salter (sister to Brian Duppa,
bishop of Sarum), from his nephew <John> Sloper, vicar of Chalke, is
false[1042]. She had him to her house indeed, but 'twas to teach her
sonne, who was such a blockhead he could not read well.

Cornelius Bee bought his library for 700 _li._, which cost him not
lesse then 2,500 _li._ Mris Powney told me that she was much against
the sale of 'em, because she knew it was his life and joy.

He might have been restored to his fellowship again, but he would not
accept the offer. He was not at all covetous, and desired only to leave
x _li._ to bury him.

He bred-up our vicar, [Sloper[1043]], who, she told me, never sent him
a token; and he is angry with her, thinks he left her too much.

She is a woman primitively good, and deserves to be remembred. I wish I
had her Christian name. Her husband has an inscription on a gravestone
in Eaton College chapel towards the south wall.

She has a handsome darke old-fashioned howse. The hall, after the old
fashion, above the wainscot, painted cloath, with godly sentences
out of the Psalmes, etc., according to the pious custome of old
times; a convenient garden and orchard. She has been handsome: a good
understanding, and cleanlie.




=Joseph Hall= (1574-1656).


[1044]Joseph Hall, bishop of Exon, etc.: he was a keeper's son in
Norfolke (I thinke, neer Norwich).--From old Mr. Theophilus Woodenoth.

He wrote most of his fine discourses at Worcester, when he was deane
there.--From Mr. Francis Potter, who went to schole there.

Monsieur Balzac exceedingly admired him and often quotes him: vide
Balzac's _Apologie_.




=Edmund Halley= (1656-1741/2).


[1045]Mr. Edmund Hally, astronomer, born October 29, 1656, London--this
nativity I had from Mr. Hally himself.

[1046]Mr. Edmund Halley[1047], Artium Magister, the eldest son of
<Edmund> Halley, a soape-boyler, a wealthy citizen of the city of
London; of the Halleys, of Derbyshire, a good family.

He was born in Shoreditch parish, at a place called Haggerston, the
backside of Hogsdon.

At 9 yeares old, his father's apprentice taught him to write, and
arithmetique. He went to Paule's schoole to Dr. Gale: while he was
there he was very perfect in the Caelestiall Globes insomuch that I
heard Mr. Moxon (the globe-maker) say that if a star were misplaced in
the globe, he would presently find it.

At ... he studyed Geometry, and at 16 could make a dyall, and then, he
said, thought himselfe a brave fellow.

At <16> went to Queen's Colledge in Oxon, well versed in Latin, Greeke,
and Hebrew: where, at the age of nineteen, he solved this useful
probleme in astronomie, never donne before, ☞ viz. 'from 3 distances
given from the sun, and angles between, to find the orbe' (mentioned
in the Philosophicall Transactions, Aug. or Sept. 1676, No. 115), for
which his name will be ever famous.

Anno Domini ... tooke his degree of Bacc. Art.; Anno Domini ... tooke
his degree of Master of Arts[1048].

Anno ... left Oxon, and lived at London with his father till <1676>;
at which time he gott leave, and a viaticum of his father, to goe
to the Island of _Sancta_ _Hellena_, purely upon the account of
advancement in Astronomy, to make the globe of the Southerne Hemisphere
right, which before was very erroneous, as being donne only after the
observations of ignorant seamen. There he stayed ... moneths. There
went over with him (amongst others) a woman ... yeares old, and her
husband ... old, who had no child in ... yeares; before he came from
the island, she was brought to bed of a child. At his returne, he
presented his Planisphere, with a short description, to his majesty who
was very well pleased with it; but received nothing but prayse.

I have often heard him say that if his majestie would be but only at
the chardge of sending out a ship, he would take the longitude and
latitude, right ascensions and declinations of ... southern fixed
starres.

Anno 1678, he added a spectacle-glasse to the shadowe-vane of the
lesser arch of the sea-quadrant (or back-staffe); which is of great
use, for that that spott of light will be manifest when you cannot see
any shadowe.

He went to Dantzick to visit Hevelius, Anno 167-.

December 1ˢᵗ, 1680, went to Paris.

[1049]Edmund Haley:--cardinall d'Estrée caressed him and sent him to
his brother the admirall with a lettre of recommendation.--He hath
contracted an acquaintance and friendship with all the eminentst
mathematicians of France and Italie, and holds a correspondence with
them.

He returned into England, Januarii 24º, 1681/2.

Quaere Mr. Partridge of his _Directio mortis_, scilicet about 35
aetatis.

[1050]<Quaere> Edmund Halley who cutts his schemes in wood? they are
well.

<David> Loggan informes me that one ... Edwards, the manciple of ...
College Oxon, doth cut in wood very well.


_Note._

In the earl of Macclesfield's library at Shirburne Castle, Oxon., are
several MSS. by Halley; among them a common-place book.




=Baldwin Hamey= (1600-1676).


[1051]In the midd aisle (or nave) of Chelsey church, a faire flat
marble grave-stone:--

    The return of Baldwin Hamey, Dr. of Physick, on the 14 of May
    being Whitsunday in the yeare of our Lord 1676 and in the 76th
    yeare of his age.

                          Psalm 146, vers. 4.

    His breath goeth, etc.




=William Harcourt= (1610-1679).


[1052]Father Harcourt--he told me that he was of the familie of Stanton
Harcourt, A.D. 1650. He was confessor, and afterwards co-executor, to
the lady Inglefield.

[1053]_Petrification of a kidney._ When father Harcourt suffered[1054]
at Tyburne, and his bowells, etc. throwne into the fire, a butcher's
boy standing by was resolved to have a piece of his kidney which
was broyling in the fire. He burn't his fingers much, but he got
it; and one ... Roydon, a brewer in Southwark, bought it, a kind of
Presbyterian. The wonder is, 'tis now absolutely petrified: I have seen
it. He much values it.

[1055]Mr. Roydon, brewer in Southwarke (opposite the Temple), haz the
piece of Father Harcourt's kidney which was snatcht out of the fire,
and now petrified and very hard. But 'twas not so hard when he first
had it. It being alwayes carried in the pocket hardened by degrees
better then by the fire--like an agate polished.




=Thomas Hariot= (1560-1621).


[1056]Mr. Thomas Hariot[EL]--from Dr. John Pell, March 31, 1680. Dr.
Pell knowes not what countreyman[1057] he was (but an Englishman he
was)--[There[1058] is a place in Kent called Harriot's-ham, now my
lord Wotton's[EM]; and in Wostershire in the parish of Droytwich is a
fine seat called Harriots, late the seate of Chiefe Baron Wyld.]

He thinkes he dyed about the time he (Dr. Pell) went to Cambridge. He
sayes my lord John Vaughan can enforme me, and haz a copie of his will:
which vide.

[1059]Mr. Thomas Hariot--Mr. Elias Ashmole thinkes he was a Lancashire
man: Mr. <John> Flamsted promised me to enquire of Mr. Townley.

[1060]☞ I very much desire to find his buriall: he was not buryed in
the Tower chapelle.

[1061]Mr. Thomas Harriot[1062]:--Memorandum:--Sir Robert Moray (from
Francis Stuart[1063]), declared at the Royal Society--'twas when the
comet[1064] appeared before the Dutch warre--that Sir Francis had heard
Mr. Harriot say that he had seen nine cometes, and had predicted seaven
of them, but did not tell them how. 'Tis very strange: excogitent
astronomi.

[1065]Mr. Hariot went with Sir Walter Ralegh into Virginia, and haz
writt the Description of Virginia, which is printed.

Dr. Pell tells me that he finds amongst his papers (which are now,
1684, in Dr. Busby's hands), an alphabet that he had contrived for the
American language, like Devills[1066].

He wrote a Description of Virginia, which is since printed in Mr.
Purchas's Pilgrims.

Vide Mr. Glanvill's Moderne Improvement of Usefull Knowledge, where he
makes mention of Mr. Thomas Harriot, pag. 33.

When <Henry Percy, ninth> earle of Northumberland, and Sir Walter
Ralegh were both prisoners in the Tower, they grew acquainted, and Sir
Walter Raleigh recommended Mr. Hariot to him, and the earle setled an
annuity of two hundred pounds a yeare on him for his life, which he
enjoyed. But to[1067] Hues[LXXV.] (who wrote _De Usu Globorum_) and to
Mr. Warner he gave an annuity but of sixty pounds per annum. These 3
were usually called the _earle of Northumberland's three Magi_. They
had a table at the earle's chardge, and the earle himselfe had them to
converse with, singly or together.

[LXXV.] Robert Hues was buried in Xt. Ch. Oxon.

He was a great acquaintance of Master ... Ailesbury, to whom Dr. Corbet
sent a letter in verse, Dec. 9, 1618, when the great blazing starre
appeared,--

    'Now for the peace of God<s> and men advise,
    (Thou that hast wherwithall to make us wise),
    Thine owne rich studies and deepe Harriot's mine,
    In which there is no drosse but all refine.'

<Vide> Dr. Corbet's poems.

The bishop of Sarum (Seth Ward) told me that one Mr. Haggar (a
countryman of his), a gentleman and good mathematician, was well
acquainted with Mr. Thomas Hariot, and was wont to say, that he did not
like (or valued not) the old storie of the Creation of the World. He
could not beleeve the old position; he would say _ex nihilo nihil fit_.
But sayd Mr. Haggar, a _nihilum_ killed him at last: for in the top of
his nose came a little red speck (exceeding small), which grew bigger
and bigger, and at last killed him. I suppose it was that which the
chirurgians call a _noli me tangere_.

[1068]Mr. Hariot dyed of an ulcer in his lippe or tongue--vide Dr.
Read's Chirurgery, where he mentions him as his patient, in the
treatise of ulcers (or cancers).

The Workes of Dr. Alexander Reade, printed, London, 1650; in the
treatise of Ulcers, p. 248. 'Cancrous ulcers (_ozana_) also seise on
this part. This griefe hastened the end of that famous mathematician
Mr. Hariot with whom I was acquainted but short time before his death;
whom at one time, together with Mr. Hughes (who wrote of the globes),
Mr. Warner, and Mr. Torporley, the noble earle of Northumberland, the
favourer of all good learning and Maecenas of learned men, maintained
while he was in the Tower, for their worth and various literature.'

He made a philosophicall theologie, wherin he castoff the Old
Testament, and then the New one would (consequently) have no
foundation. He was a Deist. His doctrine he taught to Sir Walter
Raleigh, Henry, earle of Northumberland, and some others. The divines
of those times look't on his manner of death as a judgement upon him
for nullifying the Scripture.

=Sir Edward Harley= (1624-1700).


[1069]Sir Edward Harley, knight of the Bath, was borne at his castle
of Brampton Bryan in Herefordshire. He was of Magdalen Hall, Oxon;
was governor of Dunkirke for his majestie king Charles 2ᵈ, where he
then sounded that sea from Graveling to Newport--which notes he haz by
him--of great use to seamen because of the shelves.




=Sir Robert Harley= (1580-1656).


[1070]Old Sir Robert Harley translated all the Psalmes very well. He
was of Oriell College.




=Sir Robert Harley= (1626-1673).


[1071]Sir Robert Harley[1072], second sonne of Sir Robert Harley of
Brampton-Bryan, told me that he was borne the morning that my Lord
Chancellour Bacon dyed (9º Aprilis); sed quaere, et vide his picture if
'twas not the 6ᵗʰ.

He maried....

He dyed at Brampton-Brian 16 Nov. Sunday, 6ʰ A.M., anno Domini 1673.




=James Harrington= (1611/2-1677).


[1073]James Harrington, esq.--he was borne the first Fryday[1074]
in January Anno Domini 1611, near Northampton. Quaere Mr. Marvell's
epitaph on him.

[1075]James Harrington[EN], esq., borne the first Fryday in January
1611, neer Northampton; the son of [Sir[1076] Sapcote] Harrington of
... in the countie of ..., by ..., daughter of Sir ... Samuel[1077],
was borne at [Upton[1078]] (Sir ... Samuel's house in Northamptonshire)
anno....

He was a <gentleman> commoner of Trinity Colledge in Oxford. He
travelled France, Italie, and the Netherlands. His genius lay chiefly
towards the politiques and democraticall goverment.

He was much respected by the queen of Bohemia[EO], who was bred up by
the lord Harrington's lady, and she owned the kindnes of the family.

Anno 1647, if not 6, he was by order of Parliament made one of his
Majestie's Bedchamber, at Holmeby, &c. The king loved his company;
only he would not endure to heare of a Commonwealth: and Mr. Harington
passionately loved his majestie. Mr. Harrington and the king often
disputed about goverment. He was on the scaffold with the king when
he was beheaded; and I have at these meetings[1079] oftentimes heard
him speake of king Charles I with the greatest zeale and passion
imaginable, and that his death gave him so great griefe that he
contracted a disease by it; that never any thing did goe so neer to
him. Memorandum:--Mr. <Thomas> Herbert, the traveller, was th' other of
his Bedchamber by order of Parliament, and was also on the scaffold. He
gave them both there some watches: vide Speech.

He made severall essayes in Poetry, viz. love-verses, &c., and
translated ... booke of Virgill's Æn.; but his muse was rough, and
Mr. Henry Nevill, an ingeniose and well-bred gentleman, a member of
the House of Commons, and an excellent (but concealed) poet, was his
great familiar and confident friend, and disswaded him from tampering
in poetrie which he did _invitâ Minervâ_, and to improve his proper
talent, viz. Politicall Reflections.

Whereupon he writ his _Oceana_, printed London <1656>. Mr. T. Hobbes
was wont to say that Henry Nevill had a finger in that pye; and 'tis
like enough. That ingeniose tractat, together with his and H. Nevill's
smart discourses and inculcations, dayly at coffee-houses, made many
proselytes.

[Illustration]

In so much that, anno 1659, the beginning of Michaelmas-terme, he
had every night a meeting at the (then) Turke's head, in the New
Pallace-yard, where they take water, the next house to the staires,
at one Miles's, where was made purposely a large ovall-table, with a
passage in the middle for Miles to deliver his Coffee. About it sate
his disciples, and the virtuosi. The discourses in this kind were the
most ingeniose, and smart, that ever I heard, or expect to heare, and
ban<i>ed with great eagernesse: the arguments in the Parliament howse
were but flatt to it.

He now printed a little pamphlet (4to) called _Divers modells of
Popular Government_, printed by Daniel Jakeman; and then his partie
desired him to print another little pamphlet called _The Rota_, 4to.

Here[1080] we had (very formally) a _ballotting-box_, and balloted
how things should be caried, by way of tentamens. The room was every
evening[1081] full as it could be cramm'd. I cannot now recount the
whole number:--

Mr. Cyriack Skinner, an ingeniose young gentleman, scholar to John
Milton, was chaire-man. There was Mr. Henry Nevill; major John Wildman;
Mr. <Charles> Woo<l>seley, of ..., Staffordshire; Mr. <Roger> Coke,
grandson of Sir Edward; Sir[1082] William Poultney (chaireman);
[Sir[1082] John Hoskins; J<ames> Arderne[1083];] Mr. Maximilian Petty,
a very able man in these matters, and who had more then once turn'd the
councill-board of Oliver Cromwell, his kinsman; Mr. Michael Malett;
Mr. <Philip> Carteret, of Garnesey; <Francis> Cradoc, a merchant; Mr.
Henry Ford; major ... Venner; Mr. Edward Bagshaw; [Thomas Mariet,
esq.[1084];] <William> Croon, M.D.; _cum multis aliis_ now slipt out of
my memorie[LXXVI.].

[LXXVI.] Dr. Robert Wood[EP] was of the _Rota_.--MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 11.

<Besides> which[1085] were, as auditors[1086], severall, e.g. the
earle[1087] Tirconnel; Sir John Penruddock; etc.; Mr. John Birkenhead;
as myselfe.

... Stafford, esq., as antagonists[1088].

Several officers[1089].

We many times adjourned to the Rhenish-wine howse. One time Mr.
Stafford and his gang came in, in drink, from the taverne[1090], and
affronted the Junto (Mr. Stafford tore their orders and minutes).
The soldiers offerd to kick them downe stayres, but Mr. Harrington's
moderation and persuasion hindred it.

The doctrine was very taking, and the more because, as to human
foresight, there was no possibility of the king's returne. But the
greatest part of the Parliament-men perfectly hated this designe of
_rotation by ballotting_; for they were cursed tyrants, and in love
with their power, and 'twas death to them, except 8 or 10, to admitt of
this way, for H. Nevill proposed it in the Howse, and made it out to
them, that except they embraced that modell of goverment they would be
ruind--_sed quos perdere vult Jupiter_ etc., _hos_, &c.

Pride of senators for life is insufferable; and they were able to
grind any one they owed ill will to to powder; they were hated by the
armie and their countrey they represented, and their name and memorie
stinkes--'twas worse then tyranny. Now this modell upon rotation
was:--that the third part of the Senate[1091] should rote out by ballot
every yeare, so that every ninth yeare the Howse would be wholly
alterd; no magistrate to continue above 3 yeares, and all to be chosen
by ballot, then which manner of choice, nothing can be invented more
faire and impartiall.

Well: this meeting continued Novemb., Dec., Jan., till Febr. 20 or 21;
and then, upon the unexpected turne upon generall Monke's comeing-in,
all these aierie modells vanished. Then 'twas not fitt, nay treason,
to have donne such; but I well remember, he[1092] severall times (at
the breaking-up) sayd, 'Well, the king will come in. Let him come-in,
and call a Parliament of the greatest Cavaliers in England, so they be
men of estates, and let them sett but 7 yeares, and they will all turn
Common-wealthe's men.'

He was wont to find fault with the constitution of our goverment,
that 'twas _by jumps_, and told a story of a cavaliero he sawe at the
Carnival in Italie, who rode on an excellent managed horse that with
a touch of his toe would jumpe quite round. One side of his habit was
Spanish, the other French; which sudden alteration of the same person
pleasantly surprized the spectators. 'Just so,' said he, ''tis with us.
When no Parliament, then absolute monarchie; when a Parliament, then it
runnes to Commonwealth.'

[1093]Anno Domini 1660, he was committed[1094] prisoner to the
Tower, where he was kept ...; then to Portsey castle. His durance in
these prisons (he being a gentleman of a high spirit and hot head)
was the procatractique cause of his deliration or madnesse; which
was not outragious, for he would discourse rationally enough and
be very facetious company, but he grew to have a phancy that[1095]
his perspiration turned to flies, and sometimes to bees--_ad cætera
sobrius_; and he had a timber _versatile_ built[1096] in Mr. Hart's
garden (opposite to St. James's parke) to try the experiment. He would
turne it to the sun, and sitt towards it; then he had his fox-tayles
there to chase away and massacre all the flies and bees that were to be
found there, and then shutt his chassees[1097]. Now this experiment was
only to be tryed in warme weather, and some flies would lye so close
in the cranies and the cloath (with which it was hung) that they would
not presently shew themselves. A quarter of an hower after perhaps, a
fly or two, or more, might be drawen-out of the lurking holes by the
warmeth; and then he would crye out, 'Doe not you see it apparently
that these come from me?' 'Twas the strangest sort of madnes that ever
I found in any one: talke of any thing els, his discourse would be very
ingeniose and pleasant.

Anno ... he married to his old sweet-heart Mris ... Dayrell[LXXVII.],
of ..., a comely and discreete ladie. The motto to his seale, which
was party per pale baron et femme Harrington and Dayrell was.... It
happening so, from some private reasons, that he could not enjoy his
deare in the flower and heate of his youth, he would never lye with
her, but loved and admired her dearly: for she was _vergentibus annis_
when he maried her, and had lost her sweetenesse.

[LXXVII.] His wife was ... Dayrell. Round about his seale, which was
party per pale baron and femme[1098], were these words, scil. _In
longum coiere faces_.

He was of a middling stature, well-trussed man, strong and thick,
well-sett, sanguine, quick-hott-fiery hazell eie, thick moyst curled
haire, as you may see by his picture. In his conversation very
friendly, and facetious, and hospitable.

For above twenty yeares before he died (except his imprisonment) he
lived in the Little-Ambry (a faire house on the left hand), which
lookes into the Deane's-yard in Westminster. In the upper story he had
a pretty gallery, which looked into the yard (over ... court) where he
commonly dined, and meditated, and tooke his tobacco.

His _amici_ were:--Henry Nevill, esq., who never forsooke him to his
dyeing day. Though[1099] a whole yeare before he died, his memorie
and discourse were taken away by a disease ('twas a[1100]sad sight to
see such a sample of mortality, in one whom I lately knew, a brisque,
lively cavaliero), this gentleman, whom I must never forget for his
constant friendship, payd his visits as duly and respectfully as when
his friend (J. H.) was in the prime of his understanding--a true friend.

the middle of Michaelmas-terme, and was given over upon general Monke's

house, which he gave to Caius College in Cambridge, with some lands

exchange for it, because 'twas his father's, and they all borne there;
but the Doctor (truly) thought his memory would better be preserved
this way, for his brother has left noble seates, and about 3000 _li._
per annum, at least.

He lies buried in a vault at Hempsted in Essex, which his brother Eliab
Harvey built; he is lapt in lead, and on his brest in great letters

                          DR. WILLIAM HARVEY.

I was at his funerall, and helpt to carry him into the vault.

In the library at the Physitians' Colledge was the following
inscription above his statue (which was in his doctorall robes):--

Under his white marble statue, on the pedestall, thus,

                           GULIELMO HARVEO,

                           STATOR Perpetuus.

[1114]Dr. Harvey added (or was very bountifull in contributing to)
a noble building of Roman architecture (of rustique worke, with
Corinthian pillasters) at the Physitians' College aforesaid, viz. a
great parlour[1115] for the Fellowes to meet in, belowe; and a library,
above. On the outside on the freeze, in letters 3 inches long, is this
inscription:--

SUASU ET CURA FRAN. PRUJEANI, PRÆSIDIS, ET EDMUNDI SMITH, ELECT.,
INCHOATA ET PERFECTA EST HÆC FABRICA. AN. MIƆDCLIII.

All these remembrances and building was destroyed by the generall fire.

He was alwayes very contemplative, and the first that I heare of that
was curious in anatomie in England. He had made dissections of frogges,
toades, and a number of other animals, and had curious observations
on them, which papers, together with his goods, in his lodgings at
Whitehall, were plundered at the beginning of the Rebellion, he being
for the king, and with him at Oxon; but he often sayd, that of all the
losses he sustained, no greife was so crucifying to him as the losse
of these papers, which for love or money he could never retrive or
obtaine. When Charles I[1116] by reason of the tumults left London, he
attended him, and was at the fight of Edge-hill with him; and during
the fight, the Prince and duke of Yorke were committed to his care: he
told me that he withdrew with them under a hedge, and tooke out of his
pockett a booke and read; but he had not read very long before a bullet
of a great gun grazed on the ground neare him, which made him remove
his station. He told me that Sir Adrian Scrope[1117] was dangerously
wounded there, and left for dead amongst the dead men, stript; which
happened to be the saving of his life. It was cold, cleer weather, and
a frost that night; which staunched his bleeding, and about midnight,
or some houres after his hurt, he awaked, and was faine to drawe a dead
body upon him for warmeth-sake.

After Oxford was surrendred, which was 24 July[1118] 1646, he came
to London, and lived with his brother Eliab a rich[1119] merchant in
London, on ... hill, opposite to St. Lawrence (Poultry) church[1120],
where was then a high leaden steeple (there were but two, viz. this
and St. Dunstan's in the East) and at his brother's country house at
Roe-hampton.

His brother Eliab bought, about 1654, Cockaine-house, now[1121](1680)
the Excise-Office, a noble house, where the Doctor was wont to
contemplate on the leads of the house, and had his severall stations,
in regard of the sun, or wind.

He did delight to be in the darke, and told me he could then best
contemplate. He had a house heretofore at Combe, in Surrey, a good
aire and prospect, where he had caves made in the earth, in which in
summer time he delighted to meditate.--He was pretty well versed in the
Mathematiques, and had made himselfe master of Mr. Oughtred's Clavis
Math. in his old age; and I have seen him perusing it, and working
problems, not long before he dyed, and that booke was alwayes in his
meditating apartment.

His chamber was that roome that is now the office of Elias Ashmole,
esq.; where he dyed, being taken with the dead palsye, which tooke away
his speech. As soone as he sawe he was attaqued, he presently sent for
his brother, and nephews, and gave one a watch, another another thing,
etc., as remembrances of him. He dyed worth 20,000 _li._ which he left
to his brother Eliab. In his will he left his old friend Mr. Thomas
Hobbes 10 _li._ as a token of his love.

_His sayings._--He was wont to say that man was but a great mischievous
baboon.

He would say, that we Europaeans knew not how to order or governe our
woemen, and that the Turkes were the only people used them wisely.

He was far from bigotry.

He had been physitian to the Lord Chancellor Bacon, whom he esteemed
much for his witt and style, but would not allow him to be a great
philosopher. 'He writes philosophy like a Lord Chancelor,' said he to
me, speaking in derision; 'I have cured him.'

About 1649 he travelled again into Italy, Dr. George (now Sir George)
Ent, then accompanying him.

At Oxford, he grew acquainted with Dr. Charles Scarborough, then
a young physitian (since by king Charles II knighted), in whose
conversation he much delighted; and wheras before, he[1122]marched up
and downe with the army, he tooke him to him and made him ly in his
chamber, and said to him, 'Prithee leave off thy gunning, and stay
here; I will bring thee into practice.'

I remember he kept a pretty young wench to wayte on him, which I guesse
he made use of for warmeth-sake as king David did, and tooke care of
her in his will, as also of his man servant.

For 20 yeares before he dyed he tooke no manner of care about his
worldly concernes, but his brother Eliab, who was a very wise and
prudent menager, ordered all not only faithfully, but better then he
could have donne himselfe.

He was, as all the rest of the brothers, very cholerique; and in his
young days wore a dagger (as the fashion then was, nay I remember
my old schoolemaster, old Mr. Latimer, at 70, wore a dudgeon, with
a knife, and bodkin, as also my old grandfather Lyte, and alderman
Whitson of Bristowe, which I suppose was the common fashion in their
young dayes), but this Dr. would be to<o> apt to draw-out his dagger
upon every slight occasion[1123].

He was not tall; but of the lowest stature, round faced,
olivaster[1124] complexion; little eie, round, very black, full of
spirit; his haire was black as a raven, but quite white 20 yeares
before he dyed.

I first sawe him at Oxford, 1642, after Edgehill fight, but was then
too young to be acquainted with so great a Doctor. I remember he
came severall times to Trin.[1125] Coll. to George Bathurst, B.D.,
who had a hen to hatch egges in his chamber, which they dayly opened
to discerne[1126] the progres and way of generation. I had not the
honour to be acquainted <with> him[1127] till 1651, being my she cosen
Montague's physitian and friend. I was at that time bound for Italy
(but to my great griefe disswaded by my mother's importunity). He was
very communicative, and willing to instruct any that were modest and
respectfull to him. And in order to my journey, gave me, i.e. dictated
to me, what to see, what company to keepe, what bookes to read[ES], how
to manage my studies: in short, he bid me goe to the fountain head, and
read Aristotle, Cicero, Avicenna, and did[1128] call the neoteriques
shitt-breeches. He wrote a very bad hand[ET], which (with use) I could
pretty well read.

I have heard him say, that after his booke of the Circulation of the
Blood[1129]came-out, that he fell mightily in his practize, and that
'twas beleeved by the vulgar that he was crack-brained; and all the
physitians were against his opinion, and envyed him; many wrote against
him, as Dr. Primige, Paracisanus, etc. (vide Sir George Ent's booke).
With much adoe at last, in about 20 or 30 yeares time, it was recieved
in all the Universities in the world; and, as Mr. Hobbes sayes in his
book 'De Corpore,' _he is the only man, perhaps, that ever lived to see
his owne doctrine established in his life time_.

He understood Greek and Latin pretty well, but was no critique, and
he wrote very bad Latin. The _Circuitus Sanguinis_ was, as I take it,
donne into Latin by Sir George Ent (quaere), as also his booke _de
Generatione Animalium_, but a little book in 12ᵐᵒ against Riolani
(I thinke), wherein he makes-out his doctrine clearer, was writt by
himselfe, and that, as I take it, at Oxford.

His majestie king Charles I gave him the Wardenship of Merton Colledge
in Oxford, as a reward for his service, but the times suffered him not
to recieve or injoy any benefitt by it.

He was physitian, and a great favorite of the Lord High Marshall of
England, Thomas[1130] Howard, earle of Arundel and Surrey, with whom
he travelled as his physitian in his ambassade to the Emperor ...
at Vienna, Anno Domini 163-. Mr. W. Hollar (who was then one of his
excellencie's gentlemen) told me that, in his voyage, he would still be
making of excursions into the woods, makeing observations of strange
trees, and plants, earths, etc., naturalls, and sometimes like to be
lost, so that my Lord Ambassador would be really angry with him, for
there was not only danger of thieves, but also of wild beasts.

He was much and often troubled with the gowte, and his way of cure was
thus; he would then sitt with his legges bare, if it were frost, on the
leads of Cockaine house, putt them into a payle of water, till he was
almost dead with cold, and betake himselfe to his stove, and so 'twas
gonne.

He was hott-headed, and his thoughts working would many times keepe him
from sleepinge; he told me that then his way was to rise out of his bed
and walke about his chamber in his shirt till he was pretty coole, i.e.
till he began to have a horror, and then returne to bed, and sleepe
very comfortably.

I remember he was wont to drinke coffee; which he and his brother
Eliab did, before Coffee-houses were in fashion in London.

[1131]All his profession would allowe him to be an excellent anatomist,
but I never heard of any that admired his therapeutique way. I knew
severall practisers in London[1132] that would not have given 3_d._
for one of his bills; and that a man could hardly tell by one of his
bills[1133] what he did aime at.

He did not care for chymistrey, and was wont to speake against them
with an undervalue.

It is now fitt, and but just, that I should endeavour to undecieve
the world in a scandall that I find strongly runnes of him, which I
have mett amongst some learned young men: viz. that he made himselfe a
way to putt himselfe out of his paine, by opium; not but that, had he
laboured under great paines, he had been readie enough to have donne
it; I doe not deny that it was not according to his principles upon
certain occasions to ...: but the manner of his dyeing was really, and
_bonâ fide_, thus, viz. the morning of his death about 10 a clock, he
went to speake, and found he had the dead palsey in his tongue; then he
sawe what was to become of him, he knew there was then no hopes of his
recovery, so presently sends for his young nephewes to come-up to him,
to whom he gives one his watch ('twas a minute watch with which he made
his experiments); to another, another remembrance, etc.; made signe to
... Sambroke, his apothecary (in Black-Fryars), to lett him blood in
the tongue, which did little or no good; and so he ended his dayes.
His practise was not very great towards his later end; he declined it,
unlesse to a speciall friend,--e.g. my lady Howland, who had a cancer
in her breast, which he did cutt-off and seared, but at last she dyed
of it.

He rode on horseback with a foot-cloath to visitt his patients[LXXX.],
his man following on foote, as the fashion then was, which was very
decent, now quite discontinued. The judges rode also with their
foote-cloathes to Westminster-hall, which ended at the death of Sir
Robert Hyde, Lord Chief Justice. Anthony earl of Shafton[1134], would
have revived, but severall of the judges being old and ill horsemen
would not agree to it.

[LXXX.] I have seen him ride in 1654 or 5.

Lettres on naturalls: <quaere> Mr. Samb<roke>.

The scandall aforesaid is from Sir Charles Scarborough's saying that
he had, towards his latter end, a preparation of opium and I know not
what, which he kept in his study to take, if occasion should serve, to
putt him out of his paine, and which Sir Charles promised to give him;
this I beleeve to be true; but doe not at all beleeve that he really
did give it him. The palsey did give him an easie passe-port.

I remember I have heard him say he wrote a booke _De insectis_, which
he had been many yeares about, and had made curious researches and
anatomicall observations on them. This booke was lost when his lodgings
at Whitehall were plundered in the time of the rebellion. He could
never for love nor money retrive them or heare what became of them and
sayd _'twas the greatest crucifying to him that ever he had in all his
life_.

[1135]Dr. Harvy[EU] told me, and any one if he examines himself will
find it to be true, that a man could not fancy--truthfully--that he is
imperfect in any part that he has, verbi gratiâ, teeth, eie, tongue,
spina dorsi, etc. Natura tends to perfection, and in matters of
generation we ought to consult more with our sense and instinct, then
our reason, and prudence, fashion of the country, and interest. We see
what contemptible[1136] products are of the prudent politiques[1137],
weake, fooles, and ricketty children, scandalls to nature and their
country. The heralds are fooles[1138]--_tota errant via_. A blessing
goes with a marriage for love upon a strong impulse.

[1139]_Sowgelder._ To see, Sir John, how much you are mistaken; he
that marries a widdowe makes himself cuckold. Exempli gratia, to speake
experimentally and in my trade, if a good bitch is first warded with a
curre, let her ever after be warded with a dog of a good straine and
yet she will bring curres as at first, her wombe being first infected
with a curre. So, the children will be like the first husband (like
raysing up children to your brother). So, the adulterer, though a crime
in law, the children are like the husband.

_Sir John._ Thou dost talke, me thinks, more understandingly of these
matters then any one I have mett with.

_Sowgelder._ Ah! my old friend Dr. Harvey--I knew him right well--he
made me sitt by him 2 or 3 hours together discoursing. Why! had he been
stiffe, starcht[1140], and retired, as other formall doctors are, he
had known no more then they. From the meanest person, in some way, or
other, the learnedst man may learn something. Pride has been one of the
greatest stoppers[1141] of the advancement of learning.


_Notes._

[EQ] Aubrey gives (MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 64) in trick the coat:--'or, on
a chief indented sable 3 crescents argent [Harvey]; quartering ...,
2 bars wavy ..., on a chief ... a lozenge charged with a Maltese
cross....'

[ER] i.e. the inscriptions given here are extracted from the lost
volume B. of Aubrey's antiquarian collections. July 2, 1674, Aubrey to
Wood, in MS. Ballard 14, fol. 103:--'My brother William hath my liber
B, wherin is the epitaph etc. of Dr. William Harvey's life.'

[ES] On MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 61, the blank address-side of Francis
Potter's letter (of date Dec. 7, 1652) to Aubrey are found Aubrey's
jottings of this conversation:--

[ET] Aubrey has preserved two specimens of this bad hand. MS. Aubr. 21,
fol. 77, he marks as 'Dr. Harvey's bill for my purge, Nov. 19, 1655,'
and notes 'The recipe is Dr. Harvey's own handwriting.' MS. Aubr. 21,
fol. 107, is a prescription addressed for 'Mr. Aubrey, Apr. 23, 1653,'
on which Aubrey notes 'This is Dr. William Harvey's owne writing.'

[EU] This passage, and the next, are taken from Aubrey's projected
comedy, _The Country Revel_. In all likelihood they are a reminiscence
of Harvey's familiar conversation: see p. 300, _supra_.

<James> Usher, Lord Primate of Ireland, was sent for by him, when
in his death-bed, and he would have received the sacrament. He sayd
indifferently of it that 'if there was good in any-thing 'twas in
that,' or 'if it did no good 'twould doe no hurt.' The primate refused
it, for which many blamed him. He dyed at his house in Queen street,
very serenely; asked what was a clock, answer so ...: 'then,' sayd he,
'an houre hence I shall depart.' He then turned his head to the other
side and expired. In his will he gave speciall order to have his white
stone-horse (which he loved) to be well fed and carefully looked after
as long as he lived. He had two libraries, one at London, the other at
Montgomery; one[EY] wherof he gave to Jesus College, Oxon.

I have seem him severall times with Sir John Danvers: he was a black
man.

Memorandum:--the castle of Montgomery was a most romancy seate. It
stood upon a high promontory, the north side 30+ feete high. From hence
is a most delightsome prospect, 4 severall wayes. Southwards, without
the castle, is _Prim-rose hill_: vide Donne's Poems, p. 53.

    A showre of raine, each severall drop might goe
    To his owne prim-rose, and grow manna so;
    And where their forme and their infinitie
          Make a terrestriall galaxie,
          As the small starres doe in the skie;
    I walke to find a true-love, and I see
    That 'tis not a meer woman that is shee,
    But most, or more, or lesse than woman be, etc.

[LXXXI.] In the parke.

In this pleasant solitude did this noble lord enjoy his muse. Here he
wrote his _De Veritate_. Dr. Coote (a Cambridge scholar and a learned)
was one of his chaplains. Mr. Thomas Masters, of New College, Oxon,
lived with him till 1642.

This stately castle was demolished since the late warres at the chardge
of the countrey.


_Notes._

[EX] In MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 95, Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'Party
per pale, azure and gules, 3 lions rampant argent' [Herbert of
Chirbury]: surmounted by a baron's coronet.

[EY] It was his London library that he gave to Jesus College: so

=George Herbert= (1593-1633).


[1160]Mr. George Herbert was kinsman (remote) and chapelaine to Philip,
earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, and Lord Chamberlayn. His lordship
gave him a benefice[1161] at Bemmarton[LXXXII.] (between Wilton and
Salisbury), a pittifull little chappell of ease to Foughelston. The
old house was very ruinous. Here he built a very handsome howse for
the minister, of brick, and made a good garden and walkes. He lyes in
the chancell, under no large, nor yet very good, marble grave-stone,
without any inscription.

[LXXXII.] In the records of the Tower it is writt Bymerton.

Scripsit:--Sacred Poems, called _The Church_, printed, Cambridge, 1633;
a booke entituled _The Country Parson_, not printed till about 1650,
8vo. He also writt a folio in Latin, which because the parson[LXXXIII.]
of Hineham could not read, his widowe (then wife to Sir Robert Cooke)
condemned to the uses of good houswifry.

[LXXXIII.] This account I had from Mr. Arnold Cooke, one of Sir Robert
Cooke's sonnes, whom I desired to aske his mother-in-lawe[1162] for Mr.
G. Herbert's MSS.

He was buryed (according to his owne desire) with the singing service
for the buriall of dead, by the singing men of Sarum. Fr<ancis>
Sambroke (attorney) then assisted as a chorister boy; my uncle, Thomas
Danvers, was at the funerall. Vide in the Register booke at the office
when he dyed, for the parish register is lost.

Memorandum:--in the chancell are many apt sentences of the Scripture.
At his wive's seate, _My life is hid with Christ in God_, Coloss.
iii. 3 (he hath verses on this text in his poëms). Above, in a little
windowe blinded, within a veile (ill painted), _Thou art my hideing
place_, Psalm xxxii. 7.

He maried Jane, the third daughter of Charles Danvers, of Bayntun, in
com. Wilts, esq. but had no issue by her. He was a very fine complexion
and consumptive. His mariage, I suppose, hastened his death. My
kinswoman was a handsome _bona roba_ and ingeniose.

When he was first maried he lived a yeare or better at Dantesey house.
H. Allen, of Dantesey, was well acquainted with him, who has told me
that he had a very good hand on the lute, and that he sett his own
lyricks or sacred poems. 'Tis an honour to the place, to have had the
heavenly and ingeniose contemplation of this good man, who was pious
even to prophesie;--e.g.

    'Religion now on tip-toe stands,
    Ready to goe to the American strands.'

[1163]George Herbert:--<ask> cozen Nan Garnet pro <his> picture; if
not, her aunt ... Cooke.




=Mary Herbert=, countess of Pembroke (1555-1621).


[1164]Mary[EZ], countesse of Pembroke, was sister to Sir Philip
Sydney; maried to Henry, the eldest son of William, earle of Pembroke
aforesayd; but this subtile old earle did foresee that his faire and
witty daughter-in-lawe would horne his sonne and told him so and
advised him to keepe her in the countrey and not to let her frequent
the court.

She was a beautifull ladie and had an excellent witt, and had the best
breeding that that age could afford. Shee had a pritty sharpe-ovall
face. Her haire was of a reddish yellowe.

She was very salacious, and she had a contrivance that in the spring of
the yeare[1165] ... the stallions ... were to be brought before such a
part of the house, where she had a _vidette_ to look on them.... One of
her great gallants was crooke-back't Cecill, earl of Salisbury.

In her time Wilton house was like a College, there were so many learned
and ingeniose persons. She was the greatest patronesse of witt and
learning of any lady in her time. She was a great chymist and spent
yearly a great deale in that study. She kept for her laborator[1166] in
the house Adrian Gilbert (vulgarly called Dr. Gilbert), halfe brother
to Sir Walter Ralegh, who was a great chymist in those dayes. 'Twas
he that made the curious wall about Rowlington-parke, which is the
parke that adjoyns to the house at Wilton. Mr. Henry Sanford was the
earle's secretary, a good scholar and poet, and who did penne part of
the _Arcadia_ dedicated to her (as appeares by the preface). He haz a
preface before it with the two letters of his name. 'Tis he that haz
verses before Bond's Horace. She also gave an honourable yearly pension
to Dr. <Thomas> Mouffett,[1167]who hath writt a booke _De insectis_.
Also one ... Boston, a good chymist, a Salisbury man borne, who[1168]
did undoe himselfe by studying the philosopher's stone, and she would
have kept him but he would have all the gold to him selfe and so dyed I
thinke in a goale.

At Wilton is a good library which Mr. Christopher Wase can give you
the best account of of any one; which was collected in this learned
ladie's time. There is a manuscript very elegantly written, viz. all
the Psalmes of David translated by Sir Philip Sydney, curiously bound
in crimson velvet. There is a MS. writt by Dame Marian[1169] of hunting
and hawking, in English verse, written in King Henry the 8ᵗʰ'ˢ time
(quaere Mr. Christopher Wase farther). There is the legier book of
Wilton, one page Saxon and the other Latin, which Mr. Dugdale perused.

This curious seate of Wilton and the adjacent countrey is an Arcadian
place and a paradise. Sir Philip Sydney was much here, and there
was[1170] ... great love between him and his faire sister ... I have
heard old gentlemen (old Sir Walter Long of Dracot and old Mr. Tyndale)
say ... The first Philip, earle of Pembroke, ... inherited not the witt
of either the brother or sister.

This countesse, after her lord's death, maried[LXXXIV.] to Sir Matthew
Lister[LXXXV.], knight, one of the Colledge of Physitians, London.
He was (they say) a learned and a handsome gentleman. She built then
a curious house in Bedfordshire called Houghton Lodge neer Ampthill.
The architects were sent for from Italie. It is built according to the
description of Basilius's house in the first booke of the _Arcadia_
(which is dedicated to her). It is most pleasantly situated and hath
fower visto's, each prospect 25 or 30 miles. This was sold to the earle
of Elgin for ... _li._ The house did cost 10,000 _li._ the building.

[LXXXIV.] Jack Markham saies they were not <married>.

[LXXXV.] He dyed 1644 or 1645.

I thinke she was buryed in the vault in the choire at Salisbury, by
Henry, earl of Pembroke, her first husband: but there is no memoriall
of her, nor of any of the rest, except some penons and scutcheons.

[1171]An epitaph on the lady Mary, countesse of Pembroke (in print
somewhere), by William Browne, who wrote the _Pastoralls_, whom
William, earle of Pembroke, preferr'd to be tutor to the first earle of
Carnarvon (<Robert> Dormer), which was worth to him 5 or 6000 _li._,
i.e. he bought 300 _li._ per annum land--from old Jack Markham--

    Underneath this sable hearse
    Lies the subject of all verse:
    Sydney's sister, Pembroke's mother.
    Death! er'st thou shalt kill[1172] such another
    Fair and good and learn'd as shee,
    Time will throw a[1173] dart at thee.


_Note._

[EZ] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'parted per pale azure and gules,
3 lions rampant argent [Herbert]; impaling, <or>, a pheon <azure>
[Sydney].'




=Richard Herbert= (15..-1596).


[1174](Ex libro B, p. 126):--In a buriall-place in the church at
Montgomery (belonging to the castle) is a great out-started monument of
Richard Herbert, esq. (father to the learned lord Herbert of Cherbery,
and Mr. George Herbert, who wrote the sacred poëms), where are the
effigies of him and Magdalene his wife, who afterwards was maried
to Sir John Danvers of Wilts, and lies interred at Chelsey church
but without any monument. Dr. Donne, dean of St. Paul's, preached
her funerall sermon, to which are annexed severall verses, Latin and
Greeke, by Mr. George Herbert, in memorie of her. She was buryed, as
appeares by the sermon, July 1, 1627.

    In Sepulchrum Richardi Herberti, armigeri, et Magdalenae uxoris
                        ejus, hendecasyllaba.
                Quid virtus, pietas, amorve recti,
                Tunc cum vita fugit, juvare possunt?
                In coelo relevent perenne nomen,
                Hoc saxum doceat, duos recludens
                Quos uno thalamo fideque junctos
                Heic unus tumulus lapisve signat.
                  Jam longum sape, Lector, et valeto,
                  Aeternum venerans ubique nomen.

[1175]In Brecknockshire, about 3 miles from Brecknock, is a village
called Penkelly (Anglicè _Hasel-wood_), where is a little castle. It
is an ancient seate of the Herberts. Mr. Herbert, of this place, came,
by the mother's side, of Ŵgan. The lord Cherbery's ancestor came by
the second venter, who was a miller's daughter. The greatest part of
the estate was settled on the issue by the 2d venter, viz. Montgomery
castle, and Aberystwith. Upon this match with the miller's daughter are
to this day recited, or sung, by the Welsh, these verses: viz.:--

    Ô gway vinney (dhyw) râg wilidh
    Vôd vinhad yn velinidh
    A' vôd vy mam yn velinidhes
    A' môd inney yn arglwydhes.

To this sence[FA]:--

    O God! Woe is me miserable, my father was a miller, and my
      mother a milleresse, and I am now a ladie.


_Note._

[FA] A more exact rendering is:--

    'O woe is me (God) for shame,
    That my father is a miller
    And that my mother is a miller's wife,
    And that _I_ am a peeress.'






=William Herbert=, 1st earl of Pembroke (1507-1570).


[1176]William[FB], earle of Pembroke, the first earle of that family,
was borne (I thinke I have heard my cosen Whitney say) in ... in
Monmouthshire. Herbert, of Colbrooke in Monmouthshire, is of that
family.

He was (as I take it) a younger brother, a mad fighting young fellow.
'Tis certaine he was a servant to the house of Worcester, and wore
their blew-coate and badge. My cosen Whitney's great aunt gave him a
golden angell[1177] when he went to London. One time being at Bristowe,
he was arrested, and killed one of the sheriffes of the city. He made
his escape through Back-street, through the (then great) gate, into the
Marsh, and gott into France.

Memorandum:--upon this action of killing the sheriffe, the city ordered
the gate to be walled-up, and only a little posterne gate or dore, with
a turnestile for a foot-passenger, which continued so till Bristowe was
a garrison for the king, and the great gate was then opened, in 1644,
or 1645. When I was a boy there, living with my father's mother, who
was maried to alderman John Whitson[LXXXVI.] (who was my god-father),
the story was as fresh as but of yesterday. He was called _black Will
Herbert_.

[LXXXVI.] He was the greatest benefactor to the city that haz been
since the Reformacion. He gave 500 _li._ per annum at least to the city
to maintain ... blew-coates, boies and maydes. He dyed about 1629; vide
register.

In France he betooke himself into the army, where he shewd so much
courage, and readinesse of witt in conduct, that in short time
he became eminent, and was favoured by <Francis I> the king, who
afterwards recommended him to Henry the VIII of England, who much
valued him, and heaped favours and honours upon him.

Upon the dissolution of the abbeys, he gave him the abbey of Wilton,
and a _country_ of lands and mannours thereabout belonging to it.
He gave him also the abbey of Remesbury in Wilts, with much lands
belonging to it. He gave him Cardiff-Castle in Glamorganshire, with the
ancient crowne-lands belonging to it.

Almost all the country held of this castle. It was built by Sir Robert
Fitzhamond the Norman, who lies buried at Tewkesbury abbey with a
memorial: and he built the abbey of Glocester. It afterwards came to
Jasper, duke of Bedford, etc.; so to the crowne. I have seen severall
writings of Sir John Aubrey's at Llantrithid in Glamorganshire,
which beginne[1178] thus:--'Ego Jaspar, frater regum et patruus, dux
Bedfordiae, comes Pembrochiae, et dominus de Glamorgan et Morgannog,
omnibus ad quos hoc presens scriptum pervenerit, salutem, etc.'

He maried <Anne> Par, sister of queen Katharine Par, daughter and
co-heire of <Thomas> Par (I thinke[FC], marquisse of Northampton),
by whom he had 2 sonnes, Henry, earle of Pembroke, and <Edward> the
ancestor of the lord Powys.

He was made Privy Councellor and conservator of King Henry the
Eight's[1179]will. He could neither write nor read, but had a stamp
for his name. He was of good naturall parts; but very cholerique. He
was strong sett but bony, reddish-favoured, of a sharp eie[1180],
sterne looke.

In queen Mary's time, upon the returne of the Catholique religion, the
nunnes came again to Wilton abbey, and this William, earl of Pembroke,
came to the gate (which lookes towards the court by the street, but
now is walled-up) with his cappe in hand, and fell upon his knee to
the lady abbesse[LXXXVII.] and the nunnes, crying peccavi. Upon queen
Mary's death, the earle came to Wilton (like a tygre) and turnd them
out, crying, 'Out ye whores, to worke, to worke, ye whores, goe spinne.'

[LXXXVII.] The last lady abbesse here was ... Gawen, of Norrington,
belonging to Chalke, where that family haz been 400 yeares (sold about
1665 to Judge Wadham Windham).

He being a stranger in our country, and an upstart, was much envyed.
And in those dayes (of sword and buckler), noblemen (and also great
knights, as the _Longs_), when they went to the assizes or sessions at
Salisbury, etc., had a great number of retainers following them; and
there were (you have heard), in those dayes, feudes (i.e. quarrells
and animosities) between great neighbours. Particularly this new earle
was much envyed by the then lord Sturton of Sturton[FD], who would,
when he went or returned from Sarum (by Wilton was his rode), sound his
trumpetts, and give reproachfull challenging words; 'twas a relique of
knighthood errantry.

From my great-uncles, the Brownes of Broad Chalke:--in queen
Elizabeth's time, some bishop (I have forgot who) that had been
his chaplain, was sent to him from the queen and council, to take
interrogatories of him. So he takes out his pen and inke, examines and
writes. When he had writt a good deale, sayd the earle, 'Now lett me
see it.' 'Why,' qᵈ the bishop, 'your lordship cannot read it?' 'That's
all one: I'le see it,' qᵈ he, and takes it and teares it to pieces:
'Zounds, you rascall,' qᵈ he, 'd'ee thinke I will have my throate cutt
with a penknife?' It seemes they had a mind to have pick't a hole in
his coate, and to have gott his estate.

'Tis reported that he caused himself to be lett bloud, and bled so much
that it was his death, and that he should say as he was expiring, 'They
would have Wilton--they would have Wilton,' and so gave up the ghost.

Memorandum:--this William (the founder of this family) had a little
cur-dog which loved him, and the earl loved the dog. When the earle
dyed the dog would not goe from his master's dead body, but pined
away, and dyed under the hearse; the picture of which dog is under his
picture, in the Gallery at Wilton. Which putts me in[1181]mind of a
parallell storie in Appian (Syrian Warr):--Lysimachus being slaine, a
dog that loved him stayed a long time by the body and defended it from
birds and beasts till such time as Thorax, king of Pharsalia, finding
it out gave it buriall. And I thinke there is such another story in
Pliny: vide.

He was buried in ... of St. Paule's, London, where he had a magnificent
monument, which is described, with the epitaph, by Sir William Dugdale,
which vide.

[1182]This present earl of Pembroke (1680) has at Wilton 52 mastives
and 30 grey-hounds, some beares, and a lyon, and a matter of 60
fellowes more bestiall than they.


_Notes._

[FB] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'party per pale azure and gules,
3 lions rampant argent [Herbert]; impaling, argent, 2 bars azure within
a bordure engrailed sable [Parre],' surmounted by an earl's coronet.

[FC] In error. It was Sir Thomas Parre's son William (brother of this
Anne, countess of Pembroke) who was created marquess of Northampton in
1546/7.

[FD] Charles Stourton, succeeded as 7th baron in 1548; executed for
murder in 1557.




=William Herbert=, 3rd earl of Pembroke (1580-1630).


[1183]William, earl of Pembroke, Chancellor of the University of
Oxford, natus anno MDLXXX, viii Apr.; obiit anno MDCXXX, x Calend.
Apr.[1184]--His death fell out according to prediction. He dyed a bed
of an apoplexie.

[1185]Wilhelmus, comes Pembrochiae, Cancellarius Univ.

Oxon., natus anno MDLXXX, viii Apr.; obiit anno MDCXXX, x Calend.
Apr.--His nativity was calculated by old Mr. Thomas Allen: his death
was foretold, which happened true at the time foretold. Being well in
health, he made a feast; ate and dranke plentifully; went to bed; and
found dead in the morning.

[1186]William, earle of Pembroke, Lord Chamberlain, and Chancellor of
the University of Oxford:--

    'Natus Anno MDLXXX, viii Apr.
    Obiit Anno MDCXXX, x Calend. Apr.'--

I find this under his engraved picture.

       *       *       *       *       *

He dyed of an apoplexy, and it fell-out right according to prediction,
because of which he made a great supper, and went to his bed well, but
dyed in his sleep.

He was a most magnificent and brave peer, and loved learned men. He was
a poet. There is a little booke in 12mo or 16mo which containes his
wife's and Sir Benjamin Rudyer's who was his friend and contemporary.




=John Heydon= (1629-166..).


[1187]From Elias Ashmole, esqʳᵉ, scilicet that he[1188] had the booke
called _The way to blisse_ from his adoptive father Backhowse[1189] at
Swallowfield in com. Berks., a MSS. writt in queen Elizabeth's time,
hand and stile ἀνονυμῶς.

Mr. ... Heyden maried Nicholas Culpepper's widdowe, and lights
there[1190] on the aforesayd MSS., and prints a booke with a great
deale of _The way to blisse_ word for word and verses that are printed
in the commendation of other bookes; and instead of such and such old
philosophers[1191] putts downe John Bowker and William Lilly which they
never heard of: and is so impudent in one of his bookes since as to say
Mr. Ashmole borrowed of him.




=Peter Heylyn= (1599-1662).


[1192]Dr. Heylin was buried in the choire neer his own
[subdean's[1193]] stall, May the 10th 1662[1194], but his inscription
is on the wall of the north aisle.

[1195]<Aubrey gives a copy of the inscription, noting, on the line
'posuit hoc illi moestissima conjux':--> who, about a year after, fell
in love with a lifeguardman that I know, whom she had maried (aetat.
23), had not cruel death quench't that amorous flame.

Il port 'sable, 3 horse-heads erased argent.'




=Nicholas Hill= (1570?-1610).


[1196]Mr. Nicholas Hill:--This Nicholas Hill was one of the most
learned men of his time: a great mathematician and philosopher and
traveller, and a poet[1197]. His writings had the usuall fate of those
not printed in the author's life-time. He was so eminent for knowledge,
that he was the favourite of ...[LXXXVIII.] the great earle of Oxford,
who had him to accompanie him in his travells (he was his steward),
which were so splendid and sumptuous, that he kept at Florence a
greater court then the Great Duke. This earle spent in that ... of
travelling, the inheritance of ten or twelve thousand pounds per annum.

[LXXXVIII.] 'Twas that earle of Oxford that lett the f-- before queen
Elizabeth: wherupon he travelled. Vide Stowe de hoc, in Elizabeth about
the end.

Old Serjeant Hoskins (the poet, grandfather to this Sir John Hoskins,
baronet, my honᵈ friend) knew him (was[1198] well acquainted with him),
by which meanes I have this tradicion which otherwise had been lost; as
also his very name, but only for these verses[FE] in Ben Johnson's 2d
volumine, viz.:--

       *       *       *       *       *
       *       *       *       *       *

I fancy that his picture, i.e. head, is at the end of the Long Gallery
of Pictures at Wilton[LXXXIX.], which is the most philosophicall aspect
that I have seen, very much of Mr. T. Hobbes of Malmesbury, but rather
_more antique_. 'Tis pitty that in noblemen's galleries, the names are
not writt on, or behind, the pictures.

[LXXXIX.] Philip, earl of Montgomery, Lord Chamberleyn, maried <Susan>
the daughter of <Edward Vere, 17th> earle of Oxford, by whom he had his
issue.

He writt 'Philosophia Epicureo-Democritiana, simpliciter proposita, non
edocta': printed at Colen, in 8vo or 12mo: Sir John Hoskins hath it.

Thomas Henshawe, of Kensington, esq., R. Soc. Soc., hath a treatise of
his in manuscript, which he will not print, viz. 'Of the Essence of
God, &c. Light.' It is mighty paradoxicall:--_That there is a God_;
What he is, in 10 or 12 articles: _Of the Immortality of the Soule_,
which he does demonstrate παντουσία and ὀντουσία.

[Fabian Philips, the cursiter, remembers him[1199].]

He was, as appeares by A. Wood's _Historie_, of St. John's Colledge in
Oxford, where he mentions him to be a great Lullianist.

In his travells with his lord, (I forget whither Italy or Germany, but
I thinke the former) a poor man begged him to give him _a penny_. 'A
penny!' said Mr. Hill, 'what dost say to ten pound?' 'Ah! ten pound!'
(said the beggar) 'that would make a man happy.' N. Hill gave him
immediately 10 _li._ and putt it downe upon account,--'Item, to a
beggar ten pounds, to make him happy.'

[1200]He printed 'Philosophia Epicurea Democritiana,' dedicated
'filiolo Laurentio.'--There was one Laurence Hill that did belong to
the queen's court, that was hangd with[1201] Green and Berry about Sir
Edmund-Berry Godfrey. According to age, it might be this man, but we
cannot be certain.

[1202]Mr. Thomas Henshaw bought of Nicholas Hill's widow, in Bow lane,
some of his bookes; among which is a manuscript _de infinitate et
aeternitate mundi_. He finds by his writings that he was (or leaning)
a Roman Catholique. Mr. Henshaw believes he dyed about 1610: he dyed
an old man. He flourished in queen Elizabeth's time. I will search the
register of Bowe.

[1203]I have searched the register of Bow, ubi non inventus Nicolas
Hill.

[1204]Vide tom. 1 of Ben: Johnson's workes, pag. 48, epigram CXXXIV,
title 'The famous voyage'....

    Here sev'rall ghosts did flitt,
    About the shore, of ..., but late departed;
    White, black, blew, greene; and in more formes out-started
    Than all those _Atomi_ ridiculous
    Wherof old Democrite and Hill Nicholas,
    One sayd, the other swore, the world consists.


_Note._

[FE] Aubrey was most anxious to have these verses inserted, three
times directing Anthony Wood to do so. MS. Aubr. 8, a slip at fol.
4:--'Past on Nicholas Hill, in his proper place in part 1st' <i.e. MS.
Aubr. 6>, but no copy of the verses is there given. MS. Aubr. 8, fol.
7:--'Insert B. Johnson's verses of Nicholas Hill.' MS. Wood F. 39, fol.
351ᵛ: 13 Jan. 1680/1:--'B. Johnson speakes of N. Hill in his "Voyage to
Holbourne from Puddle-dock in a ferry boate.

    A dock there is ... called _Avernus_
    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . concern us."'






=Thomas Hobbes= (1588-1679).


<This, the most elaborate of these 'Brief Lives,' occupies by itself
MS. Aubr. 9. For the letters introductory to it, see _supra_, pp. 17-20.

The various papers of which the MS. is composed are bound up
confusedly, and the separate notes are in some cases entered on a page,
or a page and its opposite, in no order. Considerable re-arrangement
has therefore been necessary; but the exact MS. references have been
given throughout. Some few notes relating to Hobbes, found in other
Aubrey MSS., have here been brought into their natural place.>

[1205]The Life of Mr. Thomas Hobbes, of Malmesburie[1206].


<_Introduction._>

The writers[1207] of the lives of the ancient philosophers used to, in
the first place, to speake of their lineage[1208]; and they tell us
that in processe of time severall great[1209] families accounted it
their glory to be branched[1210] from such or such a _Sapiens_.

Why now should that method be omitted in this _Historiola_ of our
Malmesbury philosopher? Who though but[1211] of plebeian descent[1212],
his renowne haz and will give brightnesse to his name and familie,
which hereafter may arise glorious and flourish in riches and may
justly take it an honour to be of kin to this worthy person, so famous,
for his learning[1213], both at home and abroad.

This heraldique way of expressing a genealogie is most intelligible
and makes the best impresse in the memory or fancy; but[1216] will it
not be thought here to<o> pompous and affected by his enemies and the
nation of critiques? _Prescribe Trebate._

My brother[1217] W. A. will set all this right[FF].


<_His father._>

[1218]Thomas Hobbes[FG], then, whose life I write, was second son of
Mr. Thomas Hobbes, vicar of Westport juxta Malmesbury, who maried ...
Middleton of Brokinborough (a yeomanly family).[1219]He was also vicar
of Charlton (a mile hence): they are annexed, and are both worth 60 or
80_li._ per annum.--[1220]Memorandum, Brokenborough also is appendant
to Charlton vicaridge--160_li._ per annum--from Philip Laurence, whose
father-in-law was vicar. [[1221]The vicaridge of Malmesbury is but
XX nobles per annum = 6_li._ 13_s._ 4_d._; but Coston and Radbourne
belongs to it, which addition is equal to 50 or 60_li._ per annum.]

[1222]Thomas, the father[1223], was one of the ignorant 'Sir
Johns[1224]' of queen Elizabeth's time; could[1225] only read the
prayers of the church and the homilies; and disesteemed[1226] learning
(his son Edmund told me so), as not knowing the sweetnes of it.

[1227]As to his father's ignorance and clownery, 'twas as good metall
in the oare which wants excoriating and refineing. A witt requires much
cultivation, much paines, and art and good conversation to perfect a
man.


<_His father's brother._>

[1228]He[1229] had an elder brother[FH] whose name was Francis, a
wealthy man, and had been alderman[XC.] of the borough; by profession
a glover[XCI.], which is a great trade here[XCII.], and in times past
much greater. Having no[1230]child, he contributed much to, or rather
altogether maintained, his nephew Thomas at Magdalen hall in Oxon; and
when he dyed gave him an _agellum_ (a moweing-ground[1231]) called the
Gasten-ground, lyeing neer to the horse-faire, worth 16 or 18 poundes
per annum; the rest of his landes he gave to his nephew Edmund.

[XC.] 'Alderman' is the title of the chiefe magistrate here. Alderman
and ...; vide; quaere Sir J<ames> Long.

[XCI.] Shall I expresse or conceale this (_glover_)? The philosopher
would acknowledge it.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 29ᵛ.

[XCII.] Malmesbury famous for good gloves.

[1232]At Sherston about 3 miles hence (vide map) are groundes likewise
called the Gasten-grounds--perhaps 'tis Garston grounds. At Sherston
was heretofore a castle, and perhaps (and quaere) if these grounds
are not where the _vallum_ or bulwarkes might be drawne. _Gaer_,
Britannicè, signifies some such thing, vide Dr. Davys' British
Dictionary.

In Hexham's Dutch dictionary _Gast_ signifies 'a guest'; so that
_Gasten-ground_ will be 'the ground for the guests'; probably to putt
the horses of the guests (that came to lye at the abbey) to grasse.
They speake broad in our countrey, and do pronounce guest, _gast_, etc.
Monasterys had their guest-halls; and it should seeme they had likewise
their guest-grounds for the strangers' horses: as here.


<_His brother and sister._>

[1233]Thomas, the vicar of Westport, maried ... Middleton[FI] of
Brokenborough[XCIII.] (of a yeomanly family), by whom he had two
sonnes and one daughter (quaere my brother William Aubrey)--Edmund,
his eldest (was bred-up to[1234] his uncle's profession of a glover);
and Thomas (philosopher), second son, whose life I now write. Edmund
was neer[1235] two yeares elder then his brother Thomas, and something
resembled him in aspect[1236], not so tall, but fell much short
of him in his intellect, though he was a good plain understanding
countrey-man[1237]. He had been bred at schoole with his brother; could
have made theme, and verse, and understood a little Greek to his dyeing
day. He dyed (quaere William Aubrey) about 13 yeares since, aetat.
circiter 80.

[XCIII.] Brokenbrig: vide Camden.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 30ᵛ.


<_His nephews and nieces._>

This Edmund had only one son named Francis, and two daughters maried
to countreymen (renters) in the neighborhood. This Francis pretty well
resembled his uncle Thomas, especially about the eie; and probably had
he had good education might have been ingeniose; but he drowned his
witt[1238] in ale[XCIV.]. He was left by his father and uncle Thomas,
80 _li._ (quaere W. A.) or better per annum, but he was an ill husband.
He dyed about two yeares after his father, and left five children.--His
eldest son is Thomas, a clothier, now about 23, living at[XCV.] ...
(quaere W. A.[1239]). The second, <Edmund>, lives at ...[XCVI.], and
has some lines of Thomas the philosopher. When he was a child[1240],
his genius inclined him to ([1241]quaere W. A.) draweing[1242] and
engraving in copper. He is now about 21.

[XCIV.] This part much given to drunkennes.

[XCV.] He did live at Tedbury.

[XCVI.] Did live at Chippenham.


<_Description of Malmsbury._>

    <As may be seen from his intended preface (_supra_, p. 19)
    Aubrey thought of beginning the life of Hobbes with an account
    of Malmsbury.

    For this purpose in MS. Aubr. 9 he has drawn three
    plans[1243]:--

    (a) plan of environs of Malmsbury (a slip at fol. 31ᵛ).

    (b) plan of Malmsbury (fol. 31ᵛ).

    (c) a drawing of the house in which Hobbes was born (fol. 31ᵛ).
    These are reproduced in facsimile at the end of this edition.

    He gives there (fol. 31ᵛ) these dimensions of the town:--'From
    St. John's Bridge <south limit of the town> to the abbey
    <north> is about a quarter of a mile; and from the same bridge
    to Westport church <west limit> is neer about a mile. Height of
    the borough from the levill belowe is about 100 foot high.'

    The references on the plan of Malmsbury (see the facsimile)
    are:--

  'α = the house of his birth.
  ω = Westport church.
  W = the West port (_olim_).
  β = the smyth's shop.
  δ = the private house where Mr. Latimer taught him.
  ξ = Three Tunnes (as I take it), opposite to the smyth's shop.
  [Illustration] = the religious <house> dedicated to Our Lady: the chapell is yet standing.
  H = <Hobbes's> house at the upper <end> faces the Horse fayre.
  [Illustration] = quaere if not a chapell here?'

    On fol. 31ᵛ of MS. Aubr. 9, Aubrey has these remarks about
    these plans, etc.:--

    'If these notes are not now inserted, probably they will be
    lost: or should it not be a marginall commentary?'

    'I have drawne this rude sketch meerly for your clearer
    understanding, not that I think it worth while to grave it for
    'tis at randome. I intended if it had pleased God that I had
    prospered in the world to have had taken an exact map[1244] of
    Malmesbury.'

    'Whitechurch, about a mile ferè off:--quaere ubi stat?' 'Vide
    Speed's mappe in Wiltshire.'

    'Burnevall, quasi Bournevall.'>


<_Description of Westport._>

[1245]Westport[FJ] is the parish without the west-gate (which is
now demolished), which gate stood on the neck of land that joines
Malmesbury (vide verses[FK]) to Westport. Here[FL] was, before the
late warres, a very pretty church, consisting of 3 aisles, or rather a
nave and two aisles (which tooke up the whole area[1246]), dedicated
to St. Mary; and a fair spire-steeple, with five tuneable bells,
which, when the towne was taken (about 1644; quaere William Aubrey)
by Sir W. Waller, were converted[1247] into ordinance, and the
church pulled-downe to the ground, that the enemie might not shelter
themselves against the garrison. The steeple was higher then that now
standing in the borough, which much added to[1248] the prospect. The
windowes were well painted, and in them were inscriptions that declared
much antiquitie; now is here rebuilt a church like a stable.


<_Place and date of his birth._>

Thomas Hobbes, Malmesburiensis, Philosophus, was borne at his father's
house in Westport, being that extreme howse that pointes into, or[1249]
faces, the Horse-fayre; the farthest howse on the left hand as you goe
to Tedbury, leaving the church on your right. To prevent mistakes,
and that hereafter may rise no doubt[1250] what house was famous for
this famous man's birth; I doe here testifie that in April, 1659, his
brother Edmond went with me into this house, and into the chamber where
he was borne. Now things begin to be antiquated, and I have heard some
guesse it might be at the howse where his brother Edmund lived and
dyed. But this is so, as I here[1251] deliver it. This house was given
by Thomas, the vicar, to his daughter[XCVII.] ... whose daughter or
granddaughter possessed[1252] it, when I was there.[1253]It is a firme
house, stone-built and tiled, of one roome (besides[1254] a buttery, or
the like, within) below, and two chambers above. 'Twas in the innermost
where he first drew breath.

[XCVII.] Quaere William Aubrey if ... Potluck[1255].

The day of his birth was April the fifth, Anno Domini 1588, on a Fryday
morning, which that yeare was Good Fryday. His mother fell in labour
with him upon the fright of the invasion of the Spaniards--

    [[1256]Fama[1257] ferebat enim, sparsitque per oppida nostra
        Extremum genti classe venire diem;
    Atque metum tantum concepit tunc mea mater
        Ut pareret geminos meque metumque simul.]

--[1258]he told me himself between the houres of four and six: but by
rectification his nativity is found to be at ...[XCVIII.].

[XCVIII.] See my collection of genitures[FM], where I have it more
exact from his owne mouth, viz. 5 h. 2´ mane.

His horoscope[FN] is Taurus, having in it a _satellitium_ of 5 of the
7 planets. It is a maxime in astrologie--vide Ptol. Centil.--that a
native that hath a _satellitium_ in his ascendent becomes[1259] more
eminent in his life then ordinary[1260], e.g. divers which see in
Origanus, etc., and Oliver Cromwell had so, etc.


<_His school and college life._>

At four yeares old[FO] he went to schoole in Westport church, till
eight; by that time[1261] he could read well, and number four figures.
Afterwards he went to schoole to Malmesbury, to Mr. Evans, the minister
of the towne; and afterwards to Mr. Robert Latimer, a young man of
about nineteen or twenty, newly come from the University, who then
kept a private schoole in Westport, where the broad place (quaere
nomen) is, next dore north from the smyth's shop, opposite to the Three
Cuppes[1262] (as I take it). He was a batchelour and delighted in his
scholar, T. H.'s company, and used to instruct him, and two or three
ingeniose youths more, in the evening till nine a clock. Here T. H.
so well profited in his learning, that at fourteen yeares of age, he
went away a good schoole-scholar to Magdalen-hall, in Oxford. It is not
to be forgotten, that before he went to the University, he had turned
Euripidis Medea[1263] out of Greeke into Latin Iambiques, which he
presented to his master. Mr. H. told me that he would faine have had
them, to have seen how he did grow in.... Twenty odde[1264] yeares
agoe I searcht all old Mr. Latimer's papers, but could not find them;
the[1265] good huswives had sacrificed them.

I have heard his brother Edmund and Mr. Wayte (his schoolefellowe) say
that when he was a boy he was playsome enough, but withall he had even
then a contemplative melancholinesse; he would gett him into a corner,
and learne his lesson by heart presently. His haire was black, and his
schoolfellows[1266] were wont to call him 'Crowe.'

This Mr. Latimer was a good Graecian, and the first that came into our
parts hereabout since the Reformation. He was afterwards minister of
Malmesbury, and from thence preferred to a better living of 100 _li._
per annum, or +, at Leigh-de-la-mere within this hundred.

At Oxford Mr. T. H. used, in the summer time especially, to rise
very early in the morning, and would tye the leaden-counters (which
they used in those dayes at Christmas, at post and payre) with
pacthreds[1267], which he did besmere with[1268] birdlime, and bayte
them with parings of cheese, and the jack-dawes would spye them a vast
distance up in the aire[XCIX.] and as far as Osney-abbey, and strike
at the bayte, and so be harled in the string, which the wayte of the
counter would make cling about ther wings. He did not much care for
logick, yet he learnd it, and thought himselfe a good disputant. He
tooke great delight there to goe to the[1269] booke-binders' shops, and
lye gaping on mappes, of which he takes notice in his life written by
himselfe in verse:

[XCIX.] This story he happened to tell me, discoursing of the Optiques,
to instance such sharpnes of sight in so little an eie.

    Ergo ad amoena magis me verto, librosque revolvo,
      Quos prius edoctus, non bene doctus eram.[1270]
    Pascebamque animum chartis imitantibus orbem,
      Telluris faciem, et sydera picta videns,
    Gaudebam soli comes ire, et cernere cunctis
      Terricolis justos qua facit arte dies; etc.

[1271]Quaere A<nthony> W<ood> what moneth and day he was matriculated?

[He[1272] came[1273] to Magdalen hall in the beginning of an. 1603,
at what time, Dr. James Hussee, LL.D., was principall. This James
Hussee was afterwards knighted by king James and was made Chancellour
of Sarum. This Dr. Hussee was a great encourager of towardly youths.
But he resigning his principallity about 1605, Mr. John Wilkinson
succeeded him: so that Mr. Hobs was under the government of two
principalls.[FP]--Thomas Hobs was admitted to the reading of any book
of logic ('ad[1274] lectionem cujuslibet libri logices'), that is, he
was admitted to the degree of Bachelaur of Arts, 5 Feb., 1607[1275],
and in the Lent that then began did determine[1276], that is, did his
exercise for the completion of that degree. Vide _Hist. <et Antiq.
Univ.> Oxon._, lib. 2, pag. 376 a.]


<_Enters the earl of Devonshire's service._>

[1277]After he had taken his batchelor of Arts degree (quaere A. Wood
de hoc), the than principall of Magdalen-hall (Sir James Hussey[1278])
recommended him to his yong lord when he left Oxon, who had a
conceit[1279] that he should profitt more in his learning if he had a
scholar of his owne age to wayte on him then if he had the information
of a grave doctor. He was his lordship's page, and rode a hunting and
hawking with him, and kept his privy-purse.

By this way of life he had almost forgott his Latin; vide Latin verses.
He therefore[1280] bought him bookes of an Amsterdam print that he
might carry in his pocket (particularly Caesar's Commentarys), which he
did read in the lobbey, or ante-chamber, whilest his lord was making
his visits.


<_Is servant to Francis Bacon._>

The Lord Chancellour Bacon loved to converse[C.] with him. He assisted
his lordship in translating severall of his Essayes into Latin, one,
I well remember, is[1281] that _Of the Greatnes of Cities_: the rest
I have forgott. His lordship was a very contemplative person, and
was wont to contemplate in his delicious walkes at Gorambery[FQ],
and dictate to Mr. Thomas Bushell, or some other of his gentlemen,
that attended him with inke and paper ready to sett downe presently
his thoughts. His lordship would often say that he better liked Mr.
Hobbes's taking his thoughts[1282], then any of the other, because
he understood what he wrote, which the others not understanding, my
Lord[1283] would many times have a hard taske to make sense of what
they writt.

[C.] This, I beleeve, was after his first lord's death[1284].

It is to be remembred that about these times, Mr. T. H. was much
addicted to musique, and practised on the base-violl.


<_Visits his native county, Wiltshire._>

1634: this summer--I remember 'twas in venison season[1285] (July or
August)--Mr. T. H. came into his native country[1286] to visitt his
friends, and amongst others he came then to see his old school-master,
Mr. Robert Latimer[CI.], at Leigh-de-la-mer, where I was then at
schoole[CII.] in the church[1287], newly entred into my grammar by him.
Here was the first place and time that ever I had the honour to see
this worthy, learned man, who was then pleased to take notice of me,
and the next day visited[1288] my relations[1289]. He was then a proper
man, briske, and in very good habit[1290]. His hayre was then quite
black[1291]. He stayed at Malmsbury and in the neighborhood a weeke or
better. 'Twas the last time that ever he was in Wiltshire.

[CI.] Robert Latimer obiit November 2, 1634; sed hoc nihil ad
rhombum.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 35ᵛ.

[CII.] I had then a fine little horse and commonly rode--(but this is
impertinent)--i.e. I was not a vulgar boy and carried not a satchell at
my back.--Sed hoc inter nos.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 31.

[1292]His conversation about those times was much about Ben: Jonson,
Mr. Ayton, etc.


<_His mathematical studies._>

[1293]He was (vide his life) 40 yeares[1294] old before he looked on
geometry; which happened accidentally. Being in a gentleman's library
in ..., Euclid's Elements lay open, and 'twas the 47 El.[1295] libri I.
He read the proposition. By[CIII.] G--,' sayd he, 'this is impossible!'
So he reads the demonstration of it, which referred him back to such
a proposition; which proposition he read. That referred him back to
another, which he also read. Et sic deinceps, that at last he was
demonstratively convinced of that trueth. This made him in love with
geometry.

[CIII.] He would now and then sweare, by way of emphasis[1296].

I have heard Sir Jonas Moore (and others[FR]) say that 'twas a great
pity he had not began the study of the mathematics sooner, for such
a working head[1297] would have made great advancement in it. So
had he donne[1298], he would not have layn so open to his learned
mathematicall antagonists[1299]. But one may say of him, as one
(quaere who) sayes of Jos. Scaliger, that where he erres, he erres so
ingeniosely, that one had rather erre with him then hitt the mark[1300]
with Clavius. I have heard Mr. Hobbes say[1301] that he was wont to
draw lines[1302] on his thigh and on the sheetes, abed, and[1303] also
multiply and divide. He would often complain that algebra[CIV.] (though
of great use) was too much admired, and so followed after, that it made
men not contemplate and consider so much the nature and power of lines,
which was a great hinderance to the groweth of geometrie; for that
though algebra did rarely well and quickly, and easily in right lines,
yet 'twould not _bite_ in _solid_ (I thinke) geometrie. Quod N.B.

[CIV.] Vide de hoc in his _De corpore_, and also in his 5 Dialogue.
Quaere Dr. Blackburne:--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 36.

[1304]Memorandum--After he began to reflect on[1305] the interest
of the king of England as touching his affaires between him and the
parliament, for ten yeares together his thoughts were much, or almost
altogether, unhinged from the mathematiques; but chiefly intent on
his _De Cive_, and after that on his _Leviathan_: which was a great
putt-back to his mathematicall improvement[1306]--quod N.B.--for in ten
yeares' (or better) discontinuance of that study (especially) one's
mathematiques will become very rusty[1307].


<_Champions the king's cause against the parliament._>

[1308]Vide _Mr. Hobbes considered_, p. 4: printed London 1662 (since
reprinted, 1680, by William Crooke):--

1640: 'when the parliament sate that began in April 1640 and was
dissolved in May following, and in which many pointes of the regall
power, which were necessary for the peace of the kingdome and safety
of his majestye's person, were disputed[1309] and denyed, Mr. Hobbes
wrote a little treatise in English, wherin he did sett-forth and
demonstrate, that the sayd power and rights were inseperably annexed
to the soveraignty, which soveraignty they did not then deny to be in
the king; but it seemes understood not, or would not understand, that
inseperability. Of this treatise, though not printed, many gentlemen
had copies, which occasioned much talke of the author; and had not his
majestie dissolved the parliament, it had brought him in danger of his
life.'

[1310]Vide _Mr. Hobbes considered_, if more may not be inserted,
scilicet as to the politiques. Sed cave--

            Incedis per ignes
    Suppositos cineri doloso.

             HORATIUS _ad Asin. Pollionem_, ode 1, lib. 2.

Memorandum the parliament was then sitting and runne violently against
the king's prerogative.

[1311]Memorandum he told me that bp. Manwaring[1312] (of St. David's)
preach'd _his doctrine_; for which, among others, he was sent prisoner
to the Tower. Then thought Mr. Hobbes, 'tis time now for me to shift
for my selfe, and so withdrew[1313] into France, and resided[1314]
at Paris. As I remember, there were others[1315] likewise did preach
his doctrine. This little MS. treatise grew to be[1316] his book _De
Cive_[1317], and at last grew there to be the so formidable and ...
LEVIATHAN; the manner of writing of which booke (he told me) was
thus. He walked much and contemplated, and he had in the head of his
staffe[1318] a pen and inke-horne, carried alwayes a note-booke in his
pocket, and as soon as a thought[1319] darted, he presently entred
it into his booke, or otherwise he might[1320] perhaps have lost it.
He had drawne the designe of the booke into chapters, etc. so he knew
whereabout it would come in. Thus that booke was made.

'He wrote and published the Leviathan far from the intention either of
disadvantage to his majestie, or to flatter Oliver (who was not made
Protector till three or four yeares after) on purpose to facilitate
his returne; for there is scarce a page in it that he does not upbraid
him.'--_Mr. Hobbes considered_, p. 8.

[1321]''Twas written in the behalfe of the faithfull subjects of his
majestie, that had taken his part in the war, or otherwise donne their
utmost endeavour to defend his majestie's right and person against the
rebells: wherby, having no other meanes of protection, nor (for the
most part) of subsistence, were forced to compound with your masters,
and to promise obedience for the saving of their lives and fortunes,
which, in his booke he hath affirmed, they might lawfully doe, and
consequently not bear arms against the victors. They had done their
utmost endeavour to performe their obligation to the king, had done
all they could be obliged unto; and were consequently at liberty to
seeke the safety of their lives and livelihood wheresoever, and without
treachery.'--<ibid.> p. 20.

'His majestie was displeased with him' (at Paris) 'for a while, but
not very long, by means of some's complayning of and misconstruing his
writing. But his majestie had a good opinion of him, and sayd openly
that he thought Mr. Hobbes never meant him hurt.'--p. 28.

'Before his booke _De Homine_ came forth, nothing of the optiques
writt intelligibly. As for the Optiques of Vitellio[1322], and several
others, he accounts them rather geometry than optiques.'--p. 54. [Will
not this p. 54 more aptly come in in another place?]

'So also of all other arts; not every one that brings from beyond seas
a new gin, or other janty devise, is therfore a philosopher. For if you
reckon that way, not only apothecaries and gardiners, but many other
sorts of workmen will put-in for, and get the prize--

'Then,[1323] when I see the gentlemen of Gresham Colledge apply
themselves to the doctrine of motion (as Mr. Hobbes has done, and will
be ready to helpe them in it, if they please, and so long as they use
him civilly), I will looke to know some causes of naturall events from
them, and their register, and not before; for nature does nothing but
by motion.

'The reason given by him, why the drop of glasse so much wondred at
shivers into so many pieces by breaking only one small part of it, is
approved for probable by the Royall Societie and registred in their
colledge:[CV.] but he has no reason to take it for a favour, because
hereafter the invention may be taken, by that means, not for his, but
theirs.'--p. 55.

[CV.] This clause I leave to your judgment, if not fitt to be left
out.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 38ᵛ.

'As for his selfe-prayse[CVI.], they can have very little skill in
morality, that cannot see the justice of commending a man's selfe, as
well as of any thing else, in his own defence.'--p. 57.

[CVI.] Should these excerpts of his moralls come in here, or rather be
cast-after to another place?--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 38ᵛ.

'Then for his morosity and peevishnesse, with which some asperse him,
all that know him familiarly, know the contrary. 'Tis true that when
vain and ignorant young scholars, unknowne to him before, come to him
on purpose to argue with him, and fall into undiscreet and uncivill
expressions, and he then appeare not well contented, 'twas not his
morosity, but their vanity, which should be blamed.'--<_Mr. Hobbes
considered_> p. 59.


<_Residence in Paris._>

[1324]During his stay at Paris he went through a course of chymistry
with Dr. ... Davison; and he there also studied Vesalius's Anatomie.
This I am sure was before 1648; for that Sir William Petty (then Dr.
Petty, physitian) studyed and dissected with him. Vide pag. 18b. A.
W.[1325]


<_Return to England._>

[1326]Anno 165-[CVII.], he returned into England, and lived most
part[CVIII.] in London, in Fetter lane, where he writt, or finished,
his booke _De Corpore_, ...[1327], in Latin and then in English; and
writt his lessons against the two Savillian professors at Oxon[1328],
etc.; vide the anno Domini when printed. (Puto 1655 or 56.)

[CVII.] Quaere de hoc: vide his life.--'Twas 1650 or 1651.--MS. Aubr.
9, fol. 38ᵛ.

[CVIII.] Quaere etiam de hoc. I thinke true as I remember.--MS. Aubr.
9, fol. 38ᵛ.


<_Kindness to his nephew._>

[1329]1655 or 1656: about this time he setled the piece of land
(aforesayd), given to him by his uncle, upon his nephew Francis[CIX.]
for life, the remaynder to his nephew's eldest son, Thomas Hobbes. He
also not long after[1330] dischardged a mortgage (to my knowledge[CX.],
to Richard Thorne, an attorney) of two hundred pounds, besides the
interest thereof, with which his nephew Francis (a careles[1331]
husband) had incumbred his estate.

[CIX.] Or brother: I have now forgott. But surely 'twas to his
nephewe[1332].--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 30ᵛ.

[CX.] I doe not insert this to be published, but only my familiar way
of writing to you and to give to you the greater testimonie.--MS. Aubr.
9, fol. 39ᵛ.


<_Residence in London._>

He was much in London till the restauration of his majesty, having here
convenience not only of bookes, but of learned conversation, as Mr.
John Selden, Dr. William Harvey, John Vaughan, etc., wherof anon in the
catalogue of his acquaintance.

I have heard him say, that at his lord's house in the countrey[1333]
there was a good library, and bookes enough for him, and that his
lordship stored the library with what bookes he thought fitt to be
bought; but he sayd, the want of learned[1334] conversation[CXI.] was a
very great inconvenience[1335], and that though he conceived[1336] he
could order his thinking as well perhaps as another man, yet he found a
great defect[1337].

[CXI.] Methinkes in the country, in long time, for want of good
conservation, one's understanding (witt, invention) growes mouldy.--MS.
Aubr. 9, fol. 39ᵛ.


<_Acquaintance and studies._>

Amongst other of his acquaintance I must not forget our common friend,
Mr. Samuel Cowper, the prince of limners of this last age, who drew his
picture[CXII.] as like as art could afford, and one of the best pieces
that ever he did: which his majesty, at his returne, bought of him, and
conserves as one of his great rarities in his closet at Whitehall.

[CXII.] This picture I intend[1338] to be borrowed of his majesty, for
Mr. <David> Loggan to engrave an accurate piece by, which will sell
well both at home and abroad. Mr. Loggan is well acquainted.--MS. Aubr.
9, fol. 39ᵛ.

[1339]1659. In 1659 his lord was--and some yeares before--at Little
Salisbury-house (now turned to the Middle-Exchange), where he wrot,
among other things, a poeme, in Latin hexameter and pentameter, of
the encroachment of the clergie (both Roman and reformed) on the
civil power[FS]. I remember I saw then 500 + verses, for he numbred
every tenth as he wrote. I remember he did read Cluverius's _Historia
Universalis_, and made-up his poeme from thence. His amanuensis
remembers this poeme, for he wrote them out, but knows <not what became
of it>.

His place of meditation was then in the portico in the garden.

_His manner[1340] of thinking_:--he sayd that he sometimes would sett
his thoughts upon researching[1341] and contemplating, always with this
rule[1342] that he very much and deeply considered one thing at a time
(scilicet, a weeke or sometimes a fortnight).

There was a report[CXIII.] (and surely true) that in parliament, not
long after the king was setled, some of the bishops made a motion to
have the good old gentleman burn't for a heretique. Which he hearing,
feared that his papers might be search't by their order, and he told
me he had burn't part of them.--I have received word[1343] from his
amanuensis and executor that he 'remembers there were such verses[1344]
for he wrote them out, but knowes not what became of them, unlesse he
presented them to Judge Vaughan[1345], or burned them as I did seeme to
intimate.' ☞ But I understand since by W. Crooke, that he can retrive a
good[1346] many of them.

[CXIII.] Quaere[1347] the bishop of Sarum de hoc, i.e. pro
tempore.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 41ᵛ.


<_Secures the protection of Charles II._>

[1348]1660. The[1349] winter-time of 1659 he spent in Derbyshire.
In[FT]March following was the dawning of the coming in of our gracious
soveraigne, and in April the Aurora.

[1350]I then sent a letter to him in the countrey to advertise him of
the Advent[1351] of his master the king and desired him by all meanes
to be in London before his arrivall; and knowing[1352] his majestie
was a great lover of good painting I must needs presume he could not
but suddenly see Mr. Cowper's curious pieces, of whose fame he had so
much heard abroad and seene some of his worke, and likewise that he
would sitt to him for his picture, at which place and time he would
have the best convenience[1353] of renewing his majestie's graces to
him.[1354]He returned me thankes for my friendly intimation and came to
London in May following.

It happened, about two or three dayes after his majestie's happy
returne, that, as he was passing in his coach through the Strand, Mr.
Hobbes was standing at Little Salisbury-house gate (where his lord
then lived). The king espied him, putt of his hatt very kindly to
him, and asked him how he did. About a weeke after he had[1355] orall
conference with his majesty at[1356] Mr. S. Cowper's, where, as he
sate for his picture, he was diverted[1357] by Mr. Hobbes's pleasant
discourse[1358]. Here his majestie's favours were redintegrated to him,
and order was given that he should have free accesse to his majesty,
who was always much delighted in his witt and smart repartees.

The witts at Court were wont to bayte him. But he feared none of
them[1359], and would make his part good. The king would call him _the
beare_[CXIV.]: 'Here comes the beare to be bayted!'

[CXIV.] This is _too low_ witt to be published.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 40ᵛ.

_Repartees._ He was marvellous happy and ready in his replies, and
that without rancor (except provoked)--but now[1360] I speake of his
readinesse in replies as to witt and drollery. He would say that he did
not care to give, neither was he adroit[1361] at, a present answer to
a serious quaere: he had as lieve they should have expected an[1362]
extemporary solution to an arithmeticall probleme, for he turned and
winded and compounded in philosophy, politiques, etc., as if he had
been at analyticall[1363] worke. He alwayes avoided, as much as he
could, to conclude hastily (_Humane Nature_, p. 2). Vide[1364] p. 15 b.


<_Re-enters the household of the earl of Devonshire._>

[1365]Memorandum--from 1660 till the time[CXV.] he[1366] last went into
Derbyshire, he spent most of his time in London at his lord's (viz. at
Little Salisbury-howse; then, Queen Street; lastly, Newport-house),
following his contemplation and study. ☞ He contemplated and
invented (set downe a hint with a pencill or so) in the morning, but
compiled[1367] in the afternoon.

[CXV.] Quaere when. Quaere W. Crooke de hoc. [You[1368] say
somewhere[1369] that he went into Derbyshire, 1675. Here, while he was
at London, he was much sought after and courted: taught and directed
those that sought after him.--
MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 41ᵛ.]


<_His treatise De Legibus._>

1664. In[1370] 1664 I sayd to him 'Me thinkes 'tis pitty that you
that have such a cleare reason and working[1371] head did never take
into consideration the learning of the lawes'; and I endeavoured to
perswade him to it. But he answered that[1372] he was not like to have
life enough left to goe through with such a long and difficult taske.
I then presented him the lord chancellor Bacon's Elements of the Lawe
(a thin quarto), in order therunto and to drawe him on; which he was
pleased to accept, and perused; and the next time I came to him he
shewed me therin two cleare paralogismes in the 2nd page (_one_, I well
remember, was in page 2), which I am heartily sory are now out of my
remembrance.[1373] I desponded, for his reasons, that he should make
any _tentamen_[1374] towards this designe; but afterwards, it seemes,
in the countrey he writt his treatise _De Legibus_[FU] (unprinted) of
which Sir John Vaughan, Lord Chiefe Justice of the Common Pleas, had a
transcript, and I doe affirme that he much admired it.

[1375]Insert here part of his lettre to me about it.

'Tis thus, viz., in a letter to me[1376], dated Aug. 18, 1679, among
severall other things, he writes[1377]:--

'I have been told that my booke of the Civill Warr is come abroad
and am heartily sorry for it, especially because I could not get
his majestie to license it, not because it is ill printed or hath a
foolish title set to it, for I beleeve that any ingeniose man may
understand the wickednes of that time, notwithstanding the errors of
the presse[CXVI.].

[CXVI.] Quaere is it best to let the letter stand whole[1378] or to let
that part, of the Civill Warr, be referred to the catalogue of bookes?

'The treatise _De Legibus_ (at the end of it) is imperfect. I desire
Mr. Horne[1379] to pardon me that I cannot consent to his motion; nor
shall Mr. Crooke himselfe get my consent to print it.

'I pray you present my humble thankes to Mr. Sam. Butler.

'The privilege of stationers is, in my opinion, a very great hinderance
to the advancement of all humane learning[1380].

  'I am, sir, your very humble servant,
                            'Th. Hobbes.'


<_Proposed foundation at Malmsbury._>

[1381]1665. This yeare he told me that he was willing to doe some good
to the towne where he was borne; that his majestie loved him well, and
if I could find out something in our countrey that was in his guift,
he did beleeve he could beg it of his majestie, and seeing[1382]
he was bred a scholar, he thought it most proper to endowe[1383] a
free-schoole there; which is wanting _now_[CXVII.] (for, before the
reformation, all monasteries had great schooles appendant to them;
e.g. Magdalen schoole and New College schoole). After[1384] enquiry I
found out a piece of land in Bradon-forest (of about 25 _li._ per annum
value) that was in his majesties guift[1385], which he designed[1386]
to have obtained of his majestie for a salary for a schoolmaster;
but[CXVIII.] the queen's priests[1387] smelling-out the designe and
being[1388] his enemies, hindred[1389] this publique and charitable
intention.

[CXVII.] The burghesses give a schoolmaster X _li._ per annum out of
their....

[CXVIII.] Aubrey queries--'Will not this give offence?'--Anthony Wood
replies--'Perhaps no.'--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 42ᵛ.


<_Controversy with Dr. John Fell._>

[1674[1390]. Anno[1391] Domini 1674 Mr. Anthony à Wood sett forth
an elaborate worke of eleven[1392] yeares study, intituled _the
History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford_, wherin, in
every respective Colledge and Hall, he mentions the writers there
educated and what bookes they wrote. The deane of Christ Church having
plenipotentiary[1393] power of the presse there], perused every sheet
before 'twas to be sent to the presse[1394]; and maugre the author and
to his[1395] sore displeasure did expunge and inserted what he pleased.
Among other authors[CXIX.], he made divers alterations in Mr. Wood's
copie in the account he gives of Mr. T. Hobbes of Malmesbury's life, in
pag. 444, 445[1396], Lib. II--

[CXIX.] Memorandum--bishop John Fell did not only expunge and insert
what he pleased in Mr. Hobbes' life; but also in the lives of other
very learned men, to their disparagement, particularly of Dr. John
Prideaux, afterwards bishop of Worcester, and in the life of Dr.
<William> Twiss.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 48ᵛ.

'Vir sane de quo (inter tot prosperae et adversae famae qui de eo
sparguntur hominum sermones) hoc verissime pronuntiare fas est, animum
ipsi obtigisse, uti omnis scientiae capacissimum et infertum, ita
divitiarum, saeculi, et invidiae negligentissimum; erga cognatos et
alios pium et beneficum; inter eos quibuscum vixit, hilarem et apertum,
et sermone libero; apud exteros in summa semper veneratione habitum,'
&c.; this and much more was quite dashed out of the author's copie by
the sayd deane.

[1397]These[CXX.] additions and expunctions being made by the sayd
deane of Christ Church, without[1398] the knowledge or advice of the
authour and quite contrary to his mind, he told him it was fitt Mr.
Hobbes should know it[1399], because that his name being set to the
booke and all people knowing it to be his, he should be liable to an
answer, and so consequently be in perpetuall controversie. To this the
deane replied, 'Yea, in God's name; and great reason it was that he
should know what he had done, and what he had donne he would answer
for,' etc.

[CXX.] Me thinkes[1400] page 15 might be something extracted and
abridged; but doe you consider of it.

1674. Hereupon[1401], the author acquaints[1402]J. A., Mr. Hobbes's
correspondent, with all that had passed; J. A. acquaints Mr. Hobbes.
Mr. Hobbes takeing it ill, was resolved to vindicate himselfe in an
Epistle to the Author. Accordingly an epistle, dated Apr. 20, 1674, was
sent to the author in MS., with an intention to publish it when the
History of Oxford was to be published. Upon the reciept of Mr. Hobbes's
Epistle by Anthony à Wood, he forthwith repaired, very honestly and
without any guile, to the dean of Christ Church to communicate it to
him[1403]. The deane read it over carelesly, and not without scorne,
and when he had donne, bid Mr. Wood tell Mr. Hobbes, 'that he was an
old man, had one foote in the grave, that he should mind his latter
end, and not trouble the world any more with his papers,' etc., or to
that effect.

In the meane time Mr. Hobbes meetes with the king in the Pall-mall, in
St. James's parke; tells him how he had been served by the deane of
Christ Church, in a booke then in the presse (scilicet the 'History'
aforesayd), intituled the History and Antiquities of the Universitie of
Oxon, and withall desires his majestie to be pleased to give him leave
to vindicate himselfe. The king seeming to be troubled at the dealing
of the deane, gave Mr. Hobbes leave, conditionally that he touch
no-body but him who had abused him, neither that he should reflect upon
the Universitie.

Mr. Hobbes understanding that this History would be published at
the common Act at Oxon, about 11 July, the said yeare 1674, prints
his Epistle[1404] at London, and sends downe divers copies to Oxon,
which being dispersed at coffee-houses and stationers' shops, a copie
forthwith came to the deane's hands, who upon the reading of it fretted
and fumed[1405], sent[1406] for the author of the History and chid him,
telling withall that he had corresponded with his enemie (Hobbes). The
author replied that surely he had forgot what he had donne, for he
had communicated to him before what Mr. Hobbes had sayd and written;
wherupon the deane recollecting himselfe, told him that Hobbes should
suddenly heare more of him[1407]; so that the last sheete[1408] of
paper being then in the presse and one leafe thereof being left vacant,
the deane supplied it with this answer. Both the epistle and answer I
here exhibite.

[1409]Here insert the Epistle[1410] and Answer[1411].

To this angry[1412] answer the old gentleman never[1413] made any
reply, but slighted[1414] the Dr's passion and forgave it. But 'tis
supposed it might be the cause why Mr. Hobbes was not afterwards so
indulgent, or spared the lesse to speake his opinion, concerning the
Universities and how much their doctrine and method had contributed to
the late troubles [e.g. in his History of the Civill Warre].


<_Withdraws to Derbyshire._>

1675, mense ..., he left London _cum animo nunquam revertendi_, and
spent the remaynder of his dayes in Derbyshire with the earl of
Devonshire at Chatsworth and Hardwyck, in contemplation and study. He
wrote there[1415] ... (vide vitam).


<_His death and burial._>

[1416]Then[1417], <insert an account of> his sicknesse, death, buriall
and place, and epitaph, _which send for_[1418].

[1419]Extracted out of the executor's lettre (January 16, 1679) to me:--

'To his highly honoured friend, Jo. Aubrey, esq., these.'--

(His sicknesse) 'Worthy sir--he fell sick about the middle of October
last,' etc.[1420]--

[1421]☞ 'He dyed worth neer 1000 _li._, which (considering his charity)
was more then I expected: vide his verses[1422] in the last page.--From
W. Crooke, from Mr. Jackson who had 500 _li._ of his in his hands.--


<_Personal characteristics._>

[1423]Describe face, eyes, forehead, nose, mouth, eyebrows, figure of
the face, complexion; stature of body; shape (slender, large, neat, or
otherwise); figure of head and magnitude of head; shoulders (large,
round, etc.); arms, legs, how?--

[1424]Mr. Hobbes's person, etc.:--hazel, quick eie, which continued to
his last. He was a tall man, higher then I am by about halfe a head
(scil.... feet), i.e. I could putt my hand between my head and his
hatt.--When young he loved musique and practised on the lute. In his
old age he used to sing prick-song every night (when all were gonne and
sure nobody could heare him) for his health, which he did beleeve would
make him live two or three yeares longer.

[1425]In his youth unhealthy; of an ill yellowish complexion: wett in
his feet, and trod both his shoes the same way.

[1426]_His complexion._ In his youth he was unhealthy, and of an ill
complexion (yellowish).

His[CXXI.] lord, who was a waster, sent him up and downe to borrow
money, and to gett gentlemen to be bound for him, being ashamed to
speake him selfe: he tooke colds, being wett in his feet (then were
no hackney coaches to stand in the streetes), and trod both his shoes
aside the same way. Notwithstanding he was well-beloved: they lov'd his
company for his pleasant facetiousnes and good-nature[1427].

[CXXI.] This only _inter nos_.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 45ᵛ.

From forty, or better, he grew healthier, and then he had a fresh,
ruddy, complexion. He was _sanguineo-melancholicus_; which the
physiologers say is the most ingeniose complexion. He would say that
'there might be good witts of all complexions; but good-natured,
impossible.'

_Head._ In his old age he was very bald[1428] (which claymed a
veneration); yet within dore, he used to study, and sitt, bare-headed,
and sayd he never tooke cold in his head, but that the greatest trouble
was to keepe-off the flies from pitching on the baldnes. His head was
... inches in compasse (I have the measure), and of a mallet-forme
(approved by the physiologers).

[1429]_Skin._ His skin was soft and of that kind which my Lord
Chancellor Bacon in his _History of Life and Death_ calles a
goose-skin, i.e. of a wide texture:--

           Crassa cutis, crassum cerebrum, crassum ingenium.

_Face_ not very great; ample forehead; whiskers yellowish-redish, which
naturally turned up--which is a signe of a brisque witt, e.g. James
Howell, Henry Jacob of Merton College.

<_Beard._> Belowe he was shaved close, except a little tip under his
lip. Not but that nature[1430] could have afforded a venerable beard
(Sapientem pascere barbam--Horat. Satyr. lib. 2), but being naturally
of a cheerfull and pleasant humour[1431], he affected not at all
austerity and gravity and to looke severe. [Vide[1432] page 47 of _Mr.
Hobbes considered_--'Gravity and heavinesse of countenance are not so
good marks of assurance of God's favour, as a chearfull, charitable,
and upright behaviour, which are better signes of religion than the
zealous maintaining of controverted doctrines.'] He desired not[1433]
the reputation of his wisdome to be taken[1434] from the cutt of his
beard, but from his reason--

Barba non facit philosophum. 'Il consiste tout en la pointe de sa barbe
et en ses deux moustaches; et, par consequence, pour le diffaire il ne
faut que trois coups de ciseau.'--Balzac, _Lettres_, tom. 2, p. 242.

[1435]_Eie._ He had a good eie, and that of a hazell colour, which
was full of life and spirit, even to the last. When he was earnest
in discourse, there shone (as it were) a bright live-coale within
it.[1436]He had two kind of looks:--when he laugh't, was witty, and
in a merry humour, one could scarce see his eies; by and by, when he
was serious and positive[1437], he open'd his eies round (i.e. his
eie-lids). He had midling eies, not very big, nor very little (from Sir
W<illiam> P<etty>).

[1438]_Stature._ He was six foote high, and something better (quaere
James Wh<eldon>), and went indifferently erect, or rather, considering
his great age, very erect.

_Sight; witt._ His sight and witt continued to the last. He had a
curious sharp sight, as he had a sharpe witt, which was also so sure
and steady (and contrary to that men call _bro<a>dwittednes_) that I
have heard him oftentimes say that in[1439]multiplying and dividing
he[1440] never mistooke a figure: and so in other things.


<_Habits of body and mind._>

He thought much and with excellent method and stedinesse, which made
him seldome make a false step.

_His bookes_, vide page[1441] 22. [1442]☞ He had very few bookes. I
never sawe (nor Sir William Petty) above halfe a dozen about him in
his chamber. Homer and Virgil were commonly on his table; sometimes
Xenophon, or some probable historie, and Greek Testament, or so.

[1443]_Reading._ He had read much, if one considers his long life;
but[1444] his contemplation was much more then his reading. He was wont
to say that if he had read as much as other men, he[1445] should have
knowne no more then other men.

[1446]_His physique._ He seldome used any physique (quaere Sir
W<illiam> P<etty>). What 'twas I have forgot, but will enquire of Mr.
Shelbrooke his apothecary at the Black Spread-eagle in the Strand.

Memorandum--Mr. Hobbes was very sick and like to dye at Bristoll-house
in Queen Street, about 1668.

[1447]He had a sicknes, anno....

He was wont to say that he had rather have the advice, or take physique
from an experienced old woman, that had been at many sick people's
bed-sides, then from the learnedst but unexperienced physitian.

[1448]'Tis[1449] not consistent with an harmonicall soule to be a
woman-hater, neither had he an abhorrescence to good wine but ...--this
only _inter nos_.

[1450]_Temperance and diet._ He was, even in his youth, (generally)
temperate, both as to wine and women, (et tamen haec omnia
mediocriter)--

               Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto.

I have heard him say that he did beleeve he had been in excesse[1451]
in his life, a hundred times; which, considering his great[1452] age,
did not amount to above once a yeare. When he did drinke, he would
drinke to excesse to have the benefitt of vomiting, which he did
easily; by which benefit neither his witt was disturbt longer then he
was spuing nor his stomach oppressed; but he never was, nor could not
endure to be, habitually a good fellow, i.e. to drinke every day wine
with company, which, though not to drunkennesse, spoiles the braine.

For his last 30+ yeares, his dyet, etc., was very moderate and regular.
After sixty he dranke no wine, his stomach grew weak, and he did eate
most fish, especially whitings, for he sayd he digested fish better
then flesh. He rose about seaven, had[1453] his breakefast of bread and
butter; and tooke his walke, meditating till ten; then he did putt
downe the minutes of his thoughts, which he penned in the afternoon.

[1454]He had an inch thick board about 16 inches square, whereon paper
was pasted. On this board he drew his lines (schemes). When a line came
into his head, he would, as he was walking, take a rude memorandum of
it, to preserve it in his memory till he came to his chamber. ☞ He was
never idle; his thoughts were always working.

[1455]His dinner was provided for him exactly by eleaven, for he could
not now stay till his lord's howre--scil. about two: that his stomach
could not beare.

After dinner he tooke a pipe of tobacco, and then threw himselfe
immediately on his bed, with his band off, and slept (tooke a nap of
about halfe an howre).

In the afternoon he penned his morning thoughts.

_Exercises._ Besides his dayly walking, he did twice or thrice a yeare
play at tennis[CXXII.] (at about 75 he did it); then went to bed there
and was well rubbed[CXXIII.]. This he did believe would make him live
two or three yeares the longer.

[CXXII.] Quaere James Wheldon _de hoc_--how often, and to what
age?--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 46ᵛ.

[CXXIII.] Memorandum there was no bagnio in his time. That in Newgate
Street was built about the time of his death.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 46ᵛ.

[1456]In the countrey, for want of a tennis-court, he would walke
up-hill and downe-hill in the parke, till he was in a great sweat, and
then give the servant some money to rubbe him.

[1457]_Prudence._ He gave to his amanuensis, James Wheldon (the
earle of Devon's baker; who writes a delicate hand), his pention at
Leicester, yearly, to wayte on him, and take a care of him, which he
did performe to him living and dying, with great respect and diligence:
for which consideration he made him his executor.

_Habit._ In cold weather he commonly wore a black velvet coate, lined
with furre; if not, some other coate so lined. But all the yeare he
wore a kind of bootes[1458] of Spanish leather, laced or tyed along
the sides with black ribons.

_Singing._ He had alwayes bookes of prick-song lyeing on his
table:--e.g. of H. Lawes' etc. _Songs_--which at night, when he was
abed, and the dores made fast, and was sure nobody heard him, he sang
aloud (not that he had a very good voice) but[1459] for his health's
sake: he did beleeve it did his lunges good, and conduced much to
prolong his life.

[1460]_Shaking palsey._ He had the shaking palsey in his handes; which
began in France before the yeare 1650, and haz growne upon him by
degrees, ever since, so that he haz not been able to write very legibly
since 1665 or 1666, as I find by some of his letters[1461] to me.


<_His readiness to help with advice and money._>

[1462]His goodnes of nature and willingnes to instruct any one that was
willing to be informed and modestly desired it, which I am a witnesse
of as to my owne part and also to others.

[1463]_Charity._ His brotherly love to his kinred hath already been
spoken of. He was very charitable (pro suo modulo) to those that were
true objects of his bounty[1464]. One time, I remember, goeing in
the Strand, a poor and infirme old man craved[1465] his almes. He,
beholding him with eies of pitty and compassion, putt his hand in his
pocket, and gave him 6_d._ Sayd[1466] a divine (scil. Dr. Jaspar Mayne)
that stood by--'Would you have donne this, if it had not been Christ's
command?'--'Yea,' sayd he.--'Why?' quoth the other.--'Because,' sayd
he, 'I was in paine to consider[1467] the miserable condition of the
old man; and now my almes, giving him some reliefe, doth also ease me.'


<_Slanders concerning him._>

_Aspersions and envy._ His work was attended with envy, which threw
severall aspersions and false reports on him. For instance, one
(common) was that he was afrayd to lye alone at night in his chamber,
[I have often heard him say that he was not afrayd of of _sprights_,
but afrayd of being knockt on the head[1468] for five or ten pounds,
which rogues might thinke he had[1469] in his chamber]; and severall
other tales, as untrue.

I have heard some positively affirme that he had a yearly pension from
the king of France,--possibly for having asserted such a monarchie as
the king of France exercises, but for what other grounds I know not,
unles it be for that the present[1470] king of France is reputed an
encourager of choice and able men in all faculties who can contribute
to his greatnes. I never heard him speake of any such thing; and, since
his death, I have inquired of his most intimate friends in Derbyshire,
who write to me they never heard of any such thing. Had it been so, he,
nor they, ought to have been ashamed of it, and it had been becoming
the munificence of so great a prince to have donne it.

_Atheisme[1471]._ Testimonie[1472]. For his being branded with
atheisme, his writings and vertuous life testifie[1473] against it.
No man hath written better of ..., perhaps not so well. To prevent
such false and malicious reports, I thought fit to insert and affirme
as abovesayd.[1474]And that he was a Christian 'tis cleare, for he
recieved the sacrament of Dr. <John> Pierson, and in his confession to
Dr. John Cosins, at ..., on his (as he thought) death-bed, declared
that he liked the religion of the church of England best of all other.

He would have the worship of God performed with musique (_ad
me_[1475]).


<_Addenda._>

[1476]Though he left his native countrey[1477] at 14, and lived
so long, yet sometimes one might find a little touch of our
pronunciation.--Old Sir Thomas Malette[1478], one of the judges of the
King's Bench, knew Sir Walter Ralegh, and sayd that, notwithstanding
his great travells, conversation, learning, etc., yet he spake broade
Devonshire to his dyeing day.

[1479]Memorandum--'twas he (as he him selfe haz told me) that
<invented> the method of the oeconomie of the earle of Devon's family
and way of stating or keeping of the accounts.


<_Portraits of Hobbes._>

<i.>[1480]Desire Sir Christopher Wren or Mr. Thomas Henshawe to speake
to the king for his picture[1481] of Mr. Hobbes for Mr. <David> Loggan
to engrave it.

<ii.>[1482]He did, anno 16.. (vide the date[1483], which is on the
backside) doe me the honour to sitt for his picture to Jo. Baptist
Caspars, an excellent painter, and 'tis a good piece, which I presented
to the <Royall> Societie 12 yeares since (but will it not be improper
for me to mention my owne guift?).

                              [1484]Hanc
                             Thomae Hobbes

                                 1670.

Gett a brasse wyer to hang it[1485] by.

<iii.>[1486]Mr. Hobbes's motto upon his owne picture at Sir Charles
Scarborough's:--

    Si quaeris de me Mores inquire: sed Ille
      Qui quaerit de me, forsitan alter erit.

(Sir Charles Scarborough confessed to me that he made this distich.)

<iv.>[1487]Memorandum--there was a good painter at the earl of
Devonshire's in Derbyshire not long before Mr. Hobbes dyed, who drew
him with the great decayes of old age. Mr. William Ball hath a good
copie of it.

<v.>[1488]His motto about his picture:--

                  En quam modicè habitat philosophia.


<_His seal._>

[1489]This--

..., a bend engrailed between 6 martletts ...,

was the seale[FV] he commonly sealed his letters with, but 'twas not
his coate.

Quare whose coate it may be--if _Hobbes_?

Quaere James Wheldon the executor if this be _his_ coate of armes--for
'tis some seale--and what the colours are.--Respondet that the heralds
did offer him a coat of armes but he refused it.


<_He was 'plebeius homo.'_>

[1490]Sir William Dugdale (Clarenceux), and Sir Edward Bisshe, the
heralds, had an esteeme and respect for him, in so much that they
would have graunted him a coate of armes; but he refused it--which
methinkes he neede[1491] not have donne.

Vide Alexander Broome's poemes:--

    He that weares a brave soule and dares honestly doe
    Is a herault to himselfe and a godfather too.

[1492]Vide Ben Jonson's _Underwoods_--that 'the most worthy men have
been rock't in meane cradles.'


<_His sayings._>

[1493]'Tis of custome in the lives of wise men to putt downe their
sayings. Now if trueth (uncommon) delivered clearly and wittily may
goe[1494] for a saying, his common discourse was full of them, and
which for the most part were sharpe and significant.

Here insert the two printed papers of his sayings.

[1495]Quaere Mr. Ben. Tuke at the Ship in Paule's Church-yard for
the paper of his sayings, which Dr. Francis Bernard and his brother
Charles, etc.--a club--made.

[1496]The sheet[1497] of old Mr. Hobbes sayings was not published by
his executor, as is there printed. 'Twas (indeed) donne by Mr. ...
Blunt, Sir Henry Blunt's sonne, and 'tis well donne.

[1498]I sayd, somewhere before, that (though he was ready and happy
in repartying _in drollery_) he did not care[1499] to give a present
answer _to a question_, unless he had thoroughly considered it before:
for he was against 'too hasty concluding,' which he did endeavour as
much as he could to avoid.--This is in p. 12[1500].

[1501]Thomas Hobbs <said> that if it were not for the gallowes, some
men are of so cruell a nature as to take a delight[1502] in killing
men[FW] more than I should to kill a bird.--Entred[1503] in idea.

[1504]When Spinoza's _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_ first came out
<1670>, Mr. Edmund Waller sent it to my lord of Devonshire and desired
him to send him word what Mr. Hobbes said of it. Mr. H. told his
lordship:--

                    Ne judicate ne judicemini[1505].

He told me he had cut thorough him a barre's length, for he durst not
write so boldly.

[1506]I have heard him inveigh much against the crueltie of Moyses for
putting so many thousands to the sword for bowing to[1507] ... vide
text.

I have heard him say that Aristotle was the worst teacher that ever
was, the worst polititian and ethick--a countrey-fellow that could live
in the world <would be> as good: but his rhetorique and discourse of
animals was rare.

[1508]T. H.'s saying:--rather use an old woman[1509] that had many
yeares been at sick people's bedsides, then the learnedst young
unpractised physitian.

[1510]☞ I remember he was wont to say that 'old men were drowned
inwardly, by their owne moysture; e.g. first, the feet swell; then, the
legges; then, the belly; etc.'--This saying may be brought in, perhaps,
as to the paragraph of his sicknesse and death.

<From> Elizabeth, viscountesse Purbec. When Mr. T. Hobbes was sick
in France, the divines came to him, and tormented him (both Roman
Catholic, Church of England, and Geneva). Sayd he to them 'Let
me alone, or els I will detect all your cheates from Aaron to
yourselves.' I thinke I have heard him speake something to this purpose.

Mr. Edmund Waller sayd to me, when I desired him to write some verses
in praise of him, that he was afrayd of the churchmen: he quoted
Horace--

        Incedo per ignes
    Suppositos cineri doloso:

that, what was chiefly to be taken notice of in his elogie was that he,
being but _one_, and a private person, pulled-downe all the churches,
dispelled the mists of ignorance, and layd-open their priest-craft.


<_His writings._>

    <Aubrey several times notes his intention of drawing up a list
    of Hobbes' writings. In MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 53ᵛ, is a memorandum
    'An exact Catalogue of all the bookes he wrote,' with a mark
    showing that it was to be brought in before the notice of
    Hobbes's death, _supra_, p. 346. MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 22, is
    headed 'Catalogus librorum ab autore scriptorum,' and is left
    blank for their insertion.

    In MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 18ᵛ, is James Wheldon's answer to the
    inquiry suggested (_ut supra_) on fol. 53ᵛ:--viz.>


[1511]_A Catalogue of his bookes._

His Latine poem _of the wonders of the Peake_.

His translation of _Thucidides_ out of Greek into English.

His _Humane nature_, and _De corpore politico_ in English.

His _Leviathan_ in English.

There is also a small peece in English called _A Breefe of Aristotle's
Rhetorick_ printed by Andrew Crooke, which was his, though his name be
not to it.

There is a little booke called _Mr. Hobbes considered_, wherein there
is some passages relating to his life.

    <In MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 54ᵛ, Aubrey notes the omission of a list
    of Hobbes's writings, and on fol. 55 he adds a transcript (with
    some notes of his own) of a list by William Crooke, Hobbes'
    publisher, supplementary to that given in Anthony Wood's _Hist.
    et Antiq. Univ. Oxon._ ii. 377.>

[1512]I have no time now (in this transcript) to write the catalogue of
his bookes, and I thought to have sent your paper[1513] (which I keepe
safe) but Dr. Blackburne desires the perusall of it.--This catalogue
here I received last night from William Crooke.

A letter to the duke of Newcastle about liberty and necessity, printed
1676, and 1677. [I have this somewhere among my bookes, printed about

there is a preface to it with S. W., i.e. Seth Ward, who then had a
high esteeme of him.]

[1521]He haz omitted here Aristotel's Rhetorique, printed long since by
Andrew Crooke, but without his name; but Dr. Blackburne, W. Crooke, and
I will lay our heads together and sett these things right.

☞ It ought not to be forgotten that there is before Sir William
Davenant's heroique poem called Gondibert, a learned epistle of Mr.
Hobbes's concerning poetrie, in answer to Sir William's.

And there is also a shorter letter of Mr. Hobbes's, which the
Honourable ... Howard has printed before his heroique poem, 8vo, called
I thinke Bonduca, about 1668 or 9.

Mr. Hobbes wrote a letter to ... (a colonell, as I remember) concerning
Dr. Scargill's recantation sermon, preached at Cambridge, about 1670,
which he putt into Sir John Birkenhead's hands to be licensed, which he
refused (to collogue and flatter the bishops), and would not returne
it nor give a copie. Mr. Hobbes kept no copie, for which he was sorry.
He told me he liked it well himselfe.--[1522]Dr.[1523] Birket, my old
acquaintance, hath the ordering of Sir John Birkenhead's bookes and
papers. He hath not found it yet but hath found a letter of Mr. Hobbes
to him about it, and hath promised me if he finds it to let me have
it. ☞ Memorandum--Sir Charles Scarborough told me that he haz a copie
of it, but I could not obtaine it of him; but I will try again, if Dr.
Birket cannot find it.


<_Notes about his writings._>

    <There are several scattered notes about Hobbes' writings
    dispersed throughout MS. Aubr. 9, which may be most
    conveniently brought together here.>

His Latin _Leviathan_ is altered in many particulars, e.g. the
doctrine of the Trinity, etc., and enlarged with many considerable
particulars.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 42ᵛ.

The _Leviathan_ is translated into Dutch.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 7ᵛ.

Quaere Ph. Laurence what volume the Dutch _Leviathan_ printed and what
volumine.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 7.

_Humane Nature_, London, by Thomas Newcombe, 1650, 12mo.--Anno 1684/5
is printed by Mr. Crooke _Humane Nature_, and _Libertie and Necessity_,
in 8vo, which they call his 'Tripos.'--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 7ᵛ.

Before Thucydides, he spent two yeares in reading romances and playes,
which he haz often repented and sayd that these two yeares were lost of
him--wherin perhaps he was mistaken too. For it might furnish him with
copie of words.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 42ᵛ.

Thucydides, London, imprinted for Richard Mynne in Little Brittain at
the signe of St. Paul, MDCXXXIV.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 7ᵛ.

Mr. Henry Birchit of the Middle Temple promised to gett for me Mr.
Hobbes' letter to ... of Mr. Scargill's recantation, which he left with
Sir John Birkenhead.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 54ᵛ.

T. Hobbes--quaere Mr. H. Birchet de letter of Scargill's recantation
which Sir John Birkenhead would not licence.--MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 8.

<In MS. Aubr. 9 at the end are some of the printed tracts issued by
Hobbes in his controversy with Dr. John Wallis, viz.:--

(1) A folio sheet[1524], headed

'To the right honorable and others the learned members of the Royal
Society for the Advancement of the Sciences, presenteth to your
consideration your most humble servant Thomas Hobbes (who hath spent
much time upon the same subject) two propositions, whereof the one is
lately published by Dr. Wallis, a member of your society....

Dr. Wallis: _de motu_, cap. 5. prop. 1. | Thomas Hobbes, _Roset._ prop.
5.'

(2) A quarto sheet[1525], headed:

'To the right honourable and others the learned members of the Royal
Society for the Advancement of the Sciences, presenteth to your
consideration your most humble servant Thomas Hobbes a confutation of a
theoreme which hath a long time passed for truth.'

(3) A quarto tract[1526] (the 'Propositions' occupy 3 pages, the
'Considerations,' 4 pages), entitled:--

'Three papers presented to the Royal Society against Dr. Wallis,
together with considerations on Dr. Wallis his answers to them, by
Thomas Hobbes of Malmsbury; London, printed for the author and are to
be had at the Green Dragon without Temple Bar: 1671.'>

With Mr. Hobbes's small tracts inscribed to the Royal Society came a
letter offering that some of the small pieces of his might be published
in the Transactions; which was not donne, through Mr. Oldenburgh's
default.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 47ᵛ.

<At the end of MS. Aubr. 9 is a quarto tract of 14 pages, entitled:--

'Thomae Hobbesii Malmesburiensis vita, authore seipso[1527], Londini,
typis, anno MDCLXXIX.'

The last two lines of it are:--

    Octoginta annos complevi jam quatuorque
      Et prope stans dictat Mors mihi, Ne metue.

On these Aubrey notes (MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 68ᵛ)--

'These two last verses Dr. Blackburne altered (because of qu[=a] in
quatuor, long) in the copie printed with Mr. Hobbes's life in Latine,
and some other alterations he made, but me thinkes the sense is not so
brisque.'>

What did he write since he left London? Quaere <his> executor.--MS.
Aubr. 9, fol. 22ᵛ.

His executor acquaints William Crooke (the author's printer[1528]) and
me, in a lettre[1529] under his hand January 16, 1679, that neither
Mr. Halleley (Mr. Hobbes's intimate friend and confident) nor him
selfe have any thing in either of their hands of Mr. Hobbes's, the
very little of that kind that he left behind him being disposed of
'according to his own order' before he removed from Chatsworth. Quaere
what was that order?--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 22ᵛ.

Mr. Thomas Hobbes <has left> in MSS.

----A dialogue concerning the common lawes.

----An epitome of the Civil Warres of England from 1640 to 1660.

----Answer to _The Catching of the Leviathan_ by Dr. Bramhall.

----A historical narration concerning heresy and the punishment
thereof.--MS. Aubr. 9, a slip at fol. 27ᵛ.

Quaere Dr. Blackbourn and Mr. Crooke to know where lies or what is
become of Mr. Hobbes' _Historia Ecclesiastica Romana_? Resp.--Dr.
Blackbourne haz it; gett copie of it.--MS. Aubr. 7, a slip at fol. 8ᵛ.

In May 1688, his _Ecclesiastica Historia carmine elegiaco conscripta_,
in Latin verse, was printed at Augusta Trinobantum, scil. London.
The preface was writt by Mr. Thomas Rymer, of Graie's Inne, but
ἀνονυμῶς.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 54ᵛ.

Memorandum.--Mr. Hobbes told me he would write, in three columnes, his
doctrine, the objections, and his answers, and deposit[1530] it in the
earle of Devon's library at ... in Derbyshire. Dr. <Thomas> Bayly,
principall of New-Innhall in Oxon, tells me he hath seen it there.--MS.
Aubr. 9, fol. 2.

<MS. Aubr. 28 is a copy of the tract (63 pages).

'Mr. Hobbes considered in his loyalty, religion, reputation, and
manners, by way of letter to Dr. Wallis'; London, printed for Andrew
Crooke, 1662.

On the title-page Aubrey has the note:--

'This letter was writt (indeed) by Mr. Thomas Hobbes himselfe--Jo.
Aubrey de Easton-Pierse':

and at the end

'The second impression[1531] of this booke was from this very booke of
mine.--'Twas not to be bought.'>


<_Verses by him._>

[1532]Insert the love verses he made not long before his death:--

                                [1533]1.

    Tho' I am now past ninety, and too old
    T' expect preferment in the court of Cupid,
    And many winters made mee ev'n so cold
    I am become almost all over stupid,

                                   2.

    Yet I can love and have a mistresse too,
    As fair as can be and as wise as fair;
    And yet not, proud, nor anything will doe
    To make me of her favour to despair.

                                   3.

    To tell you who she is were very bold;
    But if i' th' character your selfe you find
    Thinke not the man a fool thô he be old
    Who loves in body fair a fairer mind.

[1534]_Catalogue[1535] of his learned familiar friends and
acquaintances_, besides those already mentioned, that I remember him to
have spoken of.

_Mr. Benjamin Johnson_, Poet-Laureat, was his loving and familiar
friend and acquaintance.

_<Sir Robert> Aiton_, Scoto-Britannus, a good poet and critique and
good scholar. He was neerly related to his lord's lady (Bruce).
And he desired Ben: Johnson, and this gentleman, to give their
judgement on his style of his translation of Thucydides.[1536]He
lyes buryd in Westminster Abbey, and hath there an elegant monument
and inscription[1537], which I will insert here or so much as may be
pertinent.

Memorandum next after ... Ayton should in order be named _Sydney
Godolphin_, esq., who left him, in his will, a legacy of an hundred
poundes: and Mr. Hobbes hath left him an eternall[1538] monument in
lib.... pag.... of his Leviathan.

_Lucius Carey, lord Falkland_ was his great friend and admirer, and
so was _Sir William Petty_; both which I have here enrolled amongst
those friends I have heard him speake of, but Dr. Blackburne left 'em
both out[1539] (to my admiration). I askt him why he had donne so? He
answered because they were both ignote to foreigners.

_Mr. Henry Gellibrand_, Astronomy professor at Gresham Colledge.

[1540]_James Harrington_, esq., who wrote against him in his _Oceana_.

_Henry Stubbes_[1541].

_Mr. Charles Cavendish_[1542], brother to the duke of Newcastle, a
learned gentleman and great mathematician.

_Mr. Laurence Rooke_, Geometry and Astronomy professor.

_Mr. ... Hallely_, his intimate friend, an old gent.

[1543]When he was at Florence (16..; vide vitam) he contracted a
friendship with the famous _Galileo Galileo_, ...[1544], whom he
extremely venerated and magnified; and not only as he was a prodigious
witt, but for his sweetnes of nature and manners. They[1545]
pretty well resembled one another as to their countenances, as
by their pictures doeth[1546] appeare; were both cheerfull and
melancholique-sanguine; and had both a consimilitie of fate, to be
hated and persecuted by the ecclesiastiques.

16..[1547], _Petrus Gassendus_[1548], S. Th. Doctor et Regius Professor
Parisiis,--vide his titles--whom he never mentions but with great
honour and respect[CXXIV.], 'doctissimus, humanissimus'; and they loved
each other entirely.

[CXXIV.] I have heard Mr. Edmund Waller say that (William) the lord
marquisse of Newcastle was a great patron to Dr. Gassendi, and M. Des
Cartes, as well as Mr. Hobbes, and that he hath dined with them all
three at the marquiss's table at Paris.--MS. Aubr. 9. fol. 50.

As also the like love and friendship was betwixt him and

_Marinus ... Mersennus_;

Monsr. _Renatus Des Cartes_[1549];

as also--

_<Johan. Franc.> Niceron_;

_Samuel Sorbier_, M. D.--vide his epistle and Gassendus's before his
_De Cive_.

_... Verdusius_, to whom he dedicates his _... Dialogi_ ([1550]vide my
_Dialogi_ for his Christian name--'tis dedicated to him).

[1551]T. H. would say that _Gassendus_ was the sweetest-natured man in
the world.

_Des Cartes_ and he were acquainted and mutually respected one another.
He would say that had he kept himself to Geometry he had been the best
geometer in the world but that his head did not lye for philosophy.

[1552]Mr. Hobbes was wont to say that had Mⁱᵉᵘʳ Des Cartes (for whom he
had a high respect) kept himselfe to geometrie, he had been the best
geometer in the world; but he could not pardon him for his writing in
defence of transubstantiation, which he knew was absolutely against
his opinion[1553] and donne meerly to putt a compliment[1554] <on> the
Jesuites.

[1555]I have heard Mr. Oates say that the Jesuites doe much glorie that
he <Des Cartes> had his education under[1556] them. 'Tis not unlikely
that the Jesuites putt him upon that treatise.

_Edmund Waller_[1557], esq., poet.

[1558]_Sir Kenelm Digby_, amicus T. H.

[1559](1648 or 49[1560], at Paris.) _Sir William Petty_ (of
Ireland[1561]), Regiae Societatis Socius, a person[1562] of a
stupendous invention[1563] and of as great prudence and humanity,
had an high[1564] esteeme of him. His acquaintance began at Paris,
1648 or 1649, at which time Mr. Hobbes studied Vesalius' Anatomy, and
Sir William with him. He then assisted Mr. Hobbes in draweing his
schemes[1565]for his booke of optiques, for he had a very fine hand in
those dayes for draweing[1566], which draughts Mr. Hobbes did[1567]
much commend. His facultie[1568] in this kind conciliated them the
sooner to the familiarity[1569] of our common friend.

_Mr. S. Cowper_ aforesayd[1570], at whose house they often mett.--He
drew his picture twice: the first the king haz, the other is yet in the
custody of his widowe; but he gave it, indeed, to me (and I promised I
would give it to the archives at Oxon,[1571] with a short inscription
on the back side, as a monument of his friendship to me and ours to
Mr. Hobbes--sed haec omnia inter nos)[1572]but I, like a foole, did
not take possession of it, for something of the garment was not quite
finished, and he dyed, I being then in the countrey--sed hoc non ad rem.

[1573]<_Sir William Petty._> I have a very fine letter from Mr.
Hobbes to me where he gives him thanks and for his booke of Duplicate
Proportion I sent him, which letter I will insert (so much as concerns
it). Sir William Petty would keepe the originall _honoris ergo_ and
gave me a copie of it, which I have not leisure to looke out.

[1574](At Paris.) _Mr. Abraham Cowley_, the poet, who hath bestowed on
him an immortal pindarique ode, which is in his poems.

(1651 or 52.) _William Harvey_, Dr. of Physique and Chirurgery,
inventor of the circulation of the bloud, who left him in his will
ten poundes, as his brother told me at his funerall. Obiit anno 1657,
aetat. 80, sepult. at Hempsted in Essex, in their[1575] vault.

_Mr. Edmund Waller_ of Beconsfield was his great friend, and
acquainted at Paris--I believe before.

When his Leviathan came out, he sent by his stationer's (Andrew
Crooke) man a copie of it, well-bound, to _Mr. John Selden_ in Aedibus
Carmeliticis. Mr. Selden told the servant, he did not know Mr. Hobbes,
but had heard much of his worth, and that he should be very glad to be
acquainted with him. Wherupon Mr. Hobbes wayted on him. From which time
there was a strict friendship between <them> to his dyeing day. He left
by his will to Mr. Hobbes a legacy of ten poundes.

_Sir John Vaughan_, Lord Chiefe Justice of the Common Pleas, was his
great acquaintance, to whom he made visitts three times or more in a
weeke--out of terme in the morning; in terme-time, in the afternoon.

_Sir Charles Scarborough_, M.D. (physitian to his royal highnesse
the duke of Yorke), who hath a very good and like picture (drawne
about 1655)[1576]of him, under which is this distich (they say of Mr.
Hobbes's making[CXXV.]),

[CXXV.] This was made by Sir Charles Scarborough, M.D.

    Si quaeris de me, Mores inquire, sed Ille
      Qui quaerit de me, forsitan alter erit;

and much loved his conversation.

_Sir Jonas Moore_, mathematicus, surveyor of his majestie's ordinance,
who had a great veneration for Mr. Hobbes, and was wont much to
lament[CXXVI.] he fell to the study of the mathematiques so late.

[CXXVI.] Does this lamenting come in aptest here, or pag.[1577] 7?--MS.
Aubr. 9, fol. 52ᵛ.

_Mr. Richard White_, who writt Hemispherium Dissectum.[1578] I have
heard Mr. Thomas Hobbes commend Richard White for a solid mathematician
and preferred him much before his brother _Thomas de Albiis_[1579] for
it.

_Sir Charles Cavendish[1580]._

_Edward, lord Herbert of Cherbery_ and Castle Island.

_Sir William Davenant_, Poet Laureat after B. Johnson, and generall of
the ordinance to the duke of Newcastle--at Paris[1581] (e.g. epistle);
perhaps before.

_William Chillingworth_, D.D.--he would commend this doctor for a very
great witt; 'But by G----' said he, 'he is like some lusty fighters
that will give a damnable back-blow now and then on their owne party.'

_George Eglionby_, D.D. and deane of Canterbury, was also his great
acquaintance. He died at Oxford[1582], 1643, of the epidemique disease
then rageing.

[1583]_Jasper Mayne_, Doctor of Divinity (chaplain to William,
marquesse of Newcastle), an old acquaintance of his.

_Mr. Francis Osburne_, author of 'Advice[1584] to a son' and severall
other treatises, was his great acquaintance.

_John Pell_, Dr. of Divinity, mathematicus, quondam professor ...[1585]
at Breda, who quotes him in his ... contra Longomontanum _de Quadratura
circuli_, for one of his jury (of 12).

_Sir George Ent_, M.D.--In a letter to Mr. J<ohn> A<ubrey> from Mr.
Thomas Hobbes:--

  'Worthy Sir,

I have receaved from Mr. Crooke the booke of Sir George Ent of the Use
of Respiration. It is a very learned and ingeniose booke full of true
and deepe philosophy. I pray you to present unto him my most humble
service. Though I recieved it but three dayes since, yet, drawen-on by
the easinesse of the style and elegancy of the language, I have read it
all over, and I give you most humble thankes for sending it to me. I
pray you present my service to Mr. Hooke[1586].

                                   I am,
                               Sir, your most obliged and humble servant,
                                                    THO: HOBBES.

  Chatsworth,
      March 25,
        1679.'

_Ralph Bathurst_, S.T.D., now deane of Welles, who hath writt verses
before his booke of Humane Nature[1587].

_Mr. Henry Stubbes_, physitian, whom he much esteemed for his great
learning and parts, but at latter end Mr. Hobbs differ'd with him
for that he wrote against the lord chancellor Bacon, and the Royall
Societie. He wrote in Mr. Hobbes' defence--vide librum[1588].

_Walter Charleton_, M.D., physitian to his majestie, and one of the
Colledge of Physitians in London, a high admirer of him.

_Mr. Samuel Butler_, the author of Hudibras.

In his ... Dialogi (vide librum) he haz a noble elogie of _Sir
Christopher Wren_, then a young scholar in Oxon, which quote; but I
thinke they were not acquainted.

_Mr. <Robert> Hooke_ loved him, but was never but once in his company.

<_Sidney Godolphin_[1589].>

[1590]To conclude, he had a high esteeme for the Royall Societie,
having sayd (vide Behemoth pag. 242, part ...) that 'Naturall
Philosophy was removed from the Universities to Gresham Colledge,'
meaning the Royall Societie that meetes there; and the Royall Societie
(generally) had the like for him: and he would long since have been
ascribed a member there, but for the sake of one[CXXVII.] or two
persons, whom he tooke to be his enemies. In their meeting at Gresham
Colledge is his picture, drawen by the life, 166- (quaere date[1591]),
by a good hand, which they much esteeme, and severall copies have been
taken of it.

[CXXVII.] Dr. Wallis (surely their Mercuries[1592] are in opposition),
and Mr. Boyle. I might add Sir Paul Neile, who disobliges
everybody.--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 53ᵛ.

[1593]Memorandum:--Dr. _Isaac Barrow_ hath mentioned Mr. T. Hobbes in
his mathematicall lectures, printed and unprinted.

[1594]Edmund Waller, esq., of Beconsfield:--'but what he was most to
<be> commended for was that he being a private person threw downe the
strongholds (ὀχυρώματα) of the Church, and lett in light.'

_Robert Stevens_, serjeant at Lawe, was wont to say of him, and
that truly, that 'no man had so much, so deeply, seriously, and
profoundly[1595] considered humane nature as he.'

[1596]Mr. John Dreyden, Poet Laureat, is his great admirer, and
oftentimes makes use of his doctrine in his playes--from Mr. Dreyden
himselfe.

[1597]Memorandum he hath no countryman living hath knowne him so long
(1633[1598]) as myselfe, or <any> of his friends, &c. <who> doth know
so much <about him.> When he had printed his translation of Thucydides
<1676: edit. 2>, his life is writt by him selfe (at my request) in the
third person, a copie wherof I have by me, [to[1599] publish after his
death if it please God I survive him.]


<_Opponents and critics._>

[1600]Now as he had these ingeniose and learned friends, and many more
(no question) that I know not or now escape my memory; so he had many
enemies (though undeserved; for he would not provoke, but if provoked,
he was sharp and bitter): and as a prophet is not esteemed in his owne
countrey, so he was more esteemed by foreigners then by his countreymen.

His chiefe antagonists were

--[_Dr.[1601] John_] _Bramhall_, bishop of [Londonderry], afterwards
[archbishop of Armagh and] primate of Ireland.

--_Seth Ward_, D.D., now bishop of Sarum, who wrote against him in his
_Vindiciae Academiarum_[1602] ἀνονυμῶς, and in.... With whom though
formerly he had some contest, for which he was sorry, yet Mr. Hobbes
had a great veneration for his[1603] worth, learning and goodnes.

--_John Wallis_, D.D., a great mathematician, and that hath deserved
exceedingly of the commonwealth of learning for the great paines
etc...., was his great antagonist in the Mathematiques. 'Twas pitty, as
is said before, that Mr. Hobbs began so late, els he would <not> have
layn so open.

'Theophilus Pike' (<i.e.> [_William_[1604]] _Lucy_, bishop of St.
David's) who wrote ['Observations, censures, and confutations of
notorious errours' in his Leviathan, 1664; they are but weak ones.]

_Mr._ [_Richard_] _Baxter_, who wrote....

[_Edward[1605] Hyde, earl of Clarendon_, who wrot against the
politicall part of his Leviathan: I have mentioned this in some letter,
but you have forgot it.]

    aliis eadem principia ad statum aristocraticum et democraticum

i. _Thomas Hobbes to Josias Pullen._

[1622]For my much honored friend Mr. Josias Pullen, Vice-principall of
Magdalen Hall in Oxon.

  Honour'd Sir,

I understand by a letter from Mr. Aubry that you desire to have the
bookes I have published to put them into the library of Magdalen Hall.
I have here sent them you, and very willingly, as being glad of the
occasion, for I assure you that I owe so much honour and respect to
that society that I would have sent them, and desired to have them
accepted, long agoe, if I could have donne it as decently as now that
you have assured me that your selfe and some others of your house have
a good opinion of them so that though the house refuse them they are
not lost. You know how much they have been decryed by Dr. Wallis and
others of the greatest sway in the University, and therfore to offer
them to any Colledge or Hall had been a greater signe of humility than
I have yet attained to.

For your owne civility in approving them, I give you many thanks; and
remain

                                   Sir,
                         Your most humble servant,
                                                    THO. HOBBES.

    Febr. 1ˢᵗ.


ii. _Thomas Hobbes to John Aubrey._

  [1624]Noble Sir,

I am very glad to hear you are well and continue your favours towards
me.

'Tis a long time since I have been able to write my selfe, and am now
so weake that it is a paine to me to dictate.

But yet I cannot choose but thanke you for this letter of Jan. 25ᵗʰ
which I receaved not till the last of ffebruary. I was assured a good
while since that Dr. Wallis his learning is no where esteemed but in
the Universities by such as have engaged themselves in the defence of
his geometry and are now ashamed to recant it. And I wonder not if Dr.
Wallis, or any other, that have studyed mathematicks onely to gaine
preferment, when his ignorance is discovered, convert his study to
jugling and to the gaining of a reputation of conjuring, decyphering,
and such arts[1625] as are in the booke[1626] you sent me.

As for the matter it selfe, I meane the teaching of a man borne deafe
and dumbe to speake, I thinke it impossible. But I doe not count him
deafe and indocible that can heare a word spoken as loud as is possible
at the very entrance to his eare, for of this I am assured that a man
borne absolutely deafe must of necessity be made to heare before he can
be made to speake, much lesse to understand. And he that could make him
heare (being a great and common good) would well deserve both to be
honoured and to be enriched. He that could make him speake a few words
onely deserved nothing. But he that brags of this and cannot doe it,
deserves to be whipt.

                          Sir, I am most heartily
                             Your most faithfull and most humble servant,
                                                  THOMAS HOBBES.

Aubrey.

    <Hobbes' letter to Crooke is found as fol. 11 of MS. Aubr. 9:
    the enclosure to Aubrey, as foll. 12, 13. Both are in James
    Wheldon's handwriting.

    It appears by the post-stamps on the backs of these letters
    that the charge for a letter was 3_d._, with 3_d._ for each
    enclosure. Thus the letters of Aug. 18, 1679, March 5, 1679/80,
    Sept. 7, 1680, are all marked as costing 3_d._ postage (MS.
    Aubr. 9, foll. 15ᵛ, 10ᵛ, 21ᵛ); while this letter to Crooke,
    with its enclosure, cost 6_d._ (_ibid._, fol. 11ᵛ); and the
    letter of Jan. 16, 1679/80, with its two enclosures, cost 9_d._
    (_ibid._ fol. 17ᵛ).>

  [1629]Sir,

I have receaved Sir George Ent's booke and Mr. Aubrey's letter, to
which I have written an answer, but I cannot tell how to send it to him
without your helpe, and therefore I have sent it to you here inclosed,
for I believe he comes now and then to your shop, and I pray you doe me
the favour to deliver it to him.

                        I rest, your humble servant
                                                    THO. HOBBES.

       *       *       *       *       *

  [1631]Worthy Sir,

I have receaved from Will: Crooke the booke of Sir George Ent of the
use of respiration. It is a very learned and ingenious booke, full of
true and deepe philosophy, and I pray you to present unto him my most
humble service. Though I receaved it but three days since, yet drawn
on by the easinesse of the style and elegance of the language I have
read it all over. And I give you most hearty thankes for sending of it
to me, and to Mr. Ent[1632] who was pleased to bestow it upon me, and
I am very glad to hear that Sir George him selfe is alive and in good
health, though I believe he is very near as old as I am.

I knew not how to addresse my letter to you, but at all adventure I
sent it inclosed in a letter to Mr. Crooke at whose shop I suppose you
sometimes looke in as you passe the street.

I pray you present my service to Mr. Hooke and thanke him for the
honour of his salutation.

            I am, Sir, your most obliged and humble servant,

                                                  THOMAS HOBBES.
    Chatsworth,
  March the 25ᵗʰ, 1679.
    [1633]To my most honoured frend,
      Mr. John Aubrey.


iv. _Thomas Hobbes to John Aubrey._

  [1634]Honored Sir,

I thanke you for your letter of Aug. 2ᵈ, and I pray you present my
humble thanks to Sir George Ent that he accepteth of my judgment upon
his booke. I fear it is rather his good nature then my merit. I am
sorry for the news you write of his son.

I have been told that my booke of the Civill Warr is come abroad, and
am sorry for it, especially because I could not get his majestye to
license it, not because it is ill printed or has a foolish title set to
it, for I believe that any ingenious man may understand the wickednesse
of that time, notwithstanding the errors of the presse.

The treatise _De Legibus_, at the end of it, is imperfect. I desire
Mr. Horne to pardon me that I consent not to his motion, nor shall Mr.
Crooke himselfe get my consent to print it.

I pray you present my humble service to Mr. Butler[1635].

The priviledge of stationers is (in my opinion) a very great hinderance
to the advancement of all humane learning.

                                     I am, Sir, your very humble servant,
                                                    THO. HOBBES.

                              [1637]Hardwick, January the 16ᵗʰ, 1679[1638].
  Sir,

Three days since I receaved your letter of the 9ᵗʰ instant together
with one from Mr. Aubrey, and because they containe both the same
particulars I thinke it unnecessary to repeat to you what I have
written back to that gentleman.

All that I can add is onely this, that neither Mr. Halleley nor I have
anything in either of our hands of Mr. Hobbes's writing, the very
little of that kind that he left behind him being disposed of according
to his own order before he removed from Chatsworth.

According to Mr. Aubrey's direction I have here inclosed my letter to
him, which I pray you present to him with my humble service as soon as
you shall see him.

                                   I am, Sir, your most humble servant,
                                                  JAMES WHELDON.

                              [1641]Hardwick, January the 16ᵗʰ, 1679[1642].
  Worthy Sir,

Having been abroad about businesse for some days, I receaved, at my
coming home, your letter of the third of this month, which evidences
the great esteeme you have for Mr. Hobbes, for which I returne you my
humble thanks, and particularly for the paines you have been pleased to
take in the large account of what you your selfe, Mr. Anthony a Wood,
and Sir George Ent designe for Mr. Hobbes his honour.

I am glad Mr. Crooke has receaved his Life in Prose, which was the
onely thing Mr. Halleley got possession of, and sent it to him[1643]
by my hand. Mr. Halleley tells me now, that Mr. Hobbes (in the time of
his sicknesse) told him he had promised it to Mr. Crooke, but said he
was unwilling it should ever be published as written by himselfe; and
I beleeve it was some such motive, which made him burne those Latine
verses Mr. Crooke sent him about that time.

For those Latine verses you mention about Ecclesiasticall Power, I
remember them, for I writ them out, but know not what became of them,
unlesse he presented them to judge Vaughan, or burned them, as you seem
to intimate.

He fell sick about the middle[1644] October last. His disease was the
strangury, and the physitians judged it incurable by reason of his
great age and naturall decay. About the 20ᵗʰ of November, my Lord
being to remove from Chatsworth to Hardwick, Mr. Hobbes would not be
left behind; and therefore with a fether bed laid into the coach,
upon which he lay warme clad, he was conveyed safely, and was in
appearance as well after that little journey as before it. But seven
or eight days after, his whole right side was taken with the dead
palsy, and at the same time he was made speechlesse. He lived after
this seven days, taking very little nourishment, slept well, and by
intervalls endeavoured to speake, but could not. In the whole time
of his sicknesse he was free from fever. He seemed therefore to dye
rather for want of the fuell of life (which was spent in him) and
meer weaknesse and decay, then by the power of his disease, which was
thought to be onely an effect of his age and weaknesse. He was born the
5th of Aprill, in the year 1588, and died the 4th of December, 1679.
He was put into a woollen shroud and coffin, which was covered with a
white sheet, and upon that a black herse cloth, and so carryed upon
men's shoulders, a little mile to[1645] church. The company, consisting
of the family and neighbours that came to his funerall, and attended
him to his grave, were very handsomely entertained with wine, burned
and raw, cake, biscuit, etc. He was buried in the parish church of
Hault Hucknall, close adjoining to the raile of the monument of the
grandmother of the present earle of Devonshire, with the service of
the Church of England by the minister of the parish. It is intended to
cover his grave with a stone of black marble as soon as it can be got
ready, with a plain inscription of his name, the place of his birth,
and the time of that and of his death.

As to his will, it is sent up to London to be proved there, and by the
copy of it, which I here send you, I beleeve you will judge it fitt to
make no mention of it in[1646]what you designe to get written by way of
Commentary on his life.

As for the palsey in his hands, it began in ffrance, before the year
1650, and has grown upon him by degrees ever since; but Mr. Halleley
remembers not how long it has disabled him to write legibly.

Mr. Halleley never heard of a pension from the ffrench king and
beleeves there was no such thing ever intended. He desires you to
accept of his thanks for your favourable remembrance of him, and of the
returne of his respects to you by me. And if hereafter you should want
any thing which we know, that might contribute[1647] to the honour of
Mr. Hobbes's memory, upon the least notice, shall readily be imparted
to you.

In the mean time, with much respect, I rest,

  Sir, your much obliged and humble servant,
                           JAMES WHELDON.

[1648]To my highly honoured frend, John Aubrey, esq., this humbly
present.

[1649]_A true copy of Mr. Hobbes's will._

The 25th day of September in the 29th year of the raigne of our
Soveraigne Lord, King Charles the Second, and in the yeare of our Lord
God, 1677.

I, Thomas Hobbes, of Malmesbury, in the county of Wilts, gent. make
this my last Will and Testament.

First, I bequeath to Mary Tirell, daughter of my deceased brother,
Edmund Hobbes, forty pounds. Item, I bequeath to Elenor Harding,
daughter also of my deceased brother, Edmund Hobbes, forty pounds.
Item, I bequeath to Elizabeth Alaby, the daughter of Thomas Alaby, two
hundred pounds, and because she is an orphan, and committed by me to
the tuition of my executor, my will is, that she should be maintained
decently by my executor, till she be 16 yeares of age, and that then
the said two hundred pounds be delivered into her hands, being intended
for her furtherance in marriage, but let her dispose of it as she
please; and if it happen that the said Elizabeth Alaby die before she
come to the age of 16 yeares, then my will is, that the said 200 _li._
be divided equally between the said Mary Tirell and Elenor Harding.

Item, whereas it hath pleased my good lord, the earle of Devonshire,
to bid me oftentimes heretofore, and now at the making of this my
last will, to dispose therein of one hundred pounds, to be paid by
his lordship, for which I give him most humble thanks; I doe give and
dispose of the same in this manner: There be five grand-children of my
brother, Edmund Hobbes, to the eldest whereof, whose name is Thomas
Hobbes, I have heretofore given a peece of land, which may and doth, I
think, content him, and therefore to the other four that are younger, I
dispose of the same 100 _li._ the gift of my lord of Devonshire, to be
divided equally amongst them, as a furtherance to bind them apprentices.

And I make and ordaine James Wheldon, servant to the earle of
Devonshire, my executor, to whom I give the residue of my money and
goods whatsoever; and because I would have him in some sort contented
for the great service he hath done me, I would pray his majestie to
what I left him to add the arreare of my pension, or as much of it as
it pleases his majestie.

                                                    (His name and seale.)
  Sealed, signed and published
        in the presence of

          JOHN ASHTON,
          WILLᴹ. BARKER.

Item I give unto Mary Dell the sum of ten pounds.

       *       *       *       *       *

I pray[1650] you keep his will private to your selfe and Mr. Hobbes's
frends onely.

  Honoured Sir,

Although for these three weekes, since I receaved your letter, I have
made all the enquiry I can, yet all that I hear of the death and
buriall of Sir Charles Cavendish is that he was interred at Bolsover in
the vault belonging to the family of the duke of Newcastle about the
year 1652 or 1653. I will continue to make further inquiry, and if I
can learne the day and the month of his death or buriall will give you
notice of it.

I have sent you underwritten Mr. Hobbes's epitaph written by himselfe,
which is but lately come to my hand from a person that copyed it from
the originall.

  With much respect, I rest, Sir,
                Your most humble and obliged servant,
                          JAMES WHELDON.

My lord of Devonshire has paid the hundred pounds to Mr. Hobbes's
kinred, which he bid Mr. Hobbes dispose of in his will.

  Deare brother,

I sopose I shall be here more then a week longer as ... I know not
whether Mr. John Stokes or Sir John Knight have the key of the study.

Jo. Tay ... buried 16 of July 1580.

Nicholas Fauckener, vicar, buried 20 July 1612.

Richard Hine[1655]....

I shall e<n>devour to set the family of the Powers to rights. It was
honest parson P<ower's> grandmoth<er I> think and Jonath. Deekes
grandmother was Thomas Lyte's sisters. Alderman Lyte's grandm. was
a P<ower> of Stanton ..., which James Power, Mr. J. G. nephew might
purchase againe with a wife, with 1500 _li._, but which formerly was
worth 360 _li._ per annum, but he's goeing to creep into one of Jon.
Deeks' woolpacks, viz. his daughter.

I was at Malmesbury but did see <neither> the church nor register
but desired Mr. Binnion the parson to doe against I come againe; but
Francis Hobbes' widow's good memory did give me much satisfaction. The
register at Westport is not 80 yeares old (not more): the paving[1656]
is all new[1657].

The old vicar Hobs was a good fellow and had been at cards all
Saturday night, and at church in his sleep he cries out 'Trafells is
troumps[1658]' (viz. clubs). Then quoth the clark, 'Then, master, he
tha<t> have ace doe rub.'

He <was> a collirice[1659] man, and a parson (which I thinke succeeded
him at Westport) provoked him (a purpose) at the church doore, soe Hobs
stroke him and was forcd to fly for it and ... in obscurity beyound
London; died there, was about 80 yeares since.

Mr. William Hobs, a great clothier (old Graye's predisessor in the
same house). He had at Cleverton 60 _li._ or 80 _li._ per annum, and
was first or 2 cousin to the philosipher. But his line is extinct.
He was parson Stump's godfather, and brake in his trade. He had 1000
_li._ left and was 1000 _li._ in debt; and at London challenged one
to throw with him one throw on the dye for 1000 _li._, and wonn, payd
his debt, and afterwards flourished in his trade, and if there be any
inscriptions of H<obbes>, it must be for him, in the abbye.

viii. _Hon. Charles Hatton to William Crooke._

    <MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 26. The letter is written by a secretary,
    the signature C. Hatton being in a different hand. Crooke has
    endorsed it (fol. 27ᵛ) 'Mr. Hatton's letter about Mr. Hobs':
    to which Aubrey has added 'scil. the lord Hatton's son.' On
    fol. 27 is a note, probably by Crooke, of the 'tracts' referred
    to, viz. 'Life[1666], Rheto<ric>[1667], Considerations[1668],
    Natural Philosophy[1669].'>

  [1670]Mr. Crooke,

I thanke you for the perusall of Mr. Hobbs his tracts which wase a
civility I did not expect or desire, for I wou'd not have you at any
time deliver any booke to any person who comes in my name unless he
then payes you for it. I did desire only to know exactly the particular
price of each tract bound apart in marble'd leather, guilt on the backe
and ribbed, which pray send me by the bearer by whom I returne you your
booke.

I have cursorily looked over Mr. Hobbs his life in Latine which I
beleeve will be a very vendible booke both here and beyond sea, for
ther is noe lover of learning but will have the curiosity to be
particularly informed of the life of soe eminent a person. And truly
the reading of it wase very satisfactory to me, for in my apprehension
it is very well writ, but I cou'd have wish'd the author had more
dilated upon some particulars; and because you intimate a designe to
publish it in English I shall hint to you that the author of the life
in Latine hath either not taken notice of at all, or too slightingly,
some things very remarkeable relating to the temper of Mr. Hobbs his
mind or to the infirmity of his body, as his extraordinary timorousnes
which he himself in his Latine poem doth very ingeniously confess and
attributes it to the influence of his mother's dread of the Spanish
invasion in 88, she being then with child of him. And I have been
informed, I think by your self, that Mr. Hobbs wase for severall
yeares before he died soe paralyticall that he wase scarce able to
write his name, and that in the absence of his amanuensis not being
able to write anything he made scrawls on a piece of paper to remind
him of the conceptions of his mind he design'd to have committed to
writing. But the author[1671] of his life in Latine only sa<i>th that
about 60 yeares of age he wase taken with a trembling in his hands,
the forerunner of the palsy; which in my apprehension deserves to be
enlarg'd upon, for it is very prodigious that neither the timorousness
of his nature from his infancy, nor the decay of his vital heat in the
extremity of old age, accompagnied with the palsy to that violence,
shou'd not have chill'd the briske fervour and vigour of his mind,
which did wonderfully continue to him to his last; which is a subject
fit to be discours'd on by a genious equally philosophicall with Mr.
Hobbs, wase that now to be hoped for. It is soe considerable to me that
I cou'd not refrayne acquainting you that in my apprehension it wase
convenient you tooke notice therof in his life you are setting forth in
English.

                                             I am, your assured freind,
                                                      C. HATTON.

  [1672]Mr. Crooke, at the Green Dragon,
            nere Temple-bar.


_Notes._

[FF] (P. 323.) On fol. 29ᵛ of MS. Aubr. 9, Anthony Wood notes:--'Send
to Malmsburie to take out of the register the Christian name of Mr.
Hobs' father, when Mr. Hobbs was borne, or when his said father
was buried.' [On this Aubrey notes:--'As I remember he dyed at
Thistleworth; vide the register booke at Thistleworth, where Mr. Hobbes
his father lived in obscurity a reader, and there dyed about 1630.']
Wood goes on:--'I remember when I was there' <in 1676, Clark's Wood's
_Life and Times_, ii. 410, 411> 'there were two inscriptions of the
Hobs on brass plates; one dyed 1606, quaere. Take out the names of all
the Hobs in the register.' Obedient to this advice, Aubrey sent his
brother William to Malmesbury: _supra_, p. 387.

[FG] (P. 323.) In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 26, Aubrey puts the substance of
this paragraph in a neater form:--

'Mr. Hobbes' father was minister of Westport, to which Brokenborough
and Charlton doe belong as chapells of ease, but all not worth
above.... He was one of the clergie of Queen Elizabeth's time--a little
learning went a great way with him and many other Sir Johns in those
days--he read homilies.'

[FH] (P. 323.) On fol. 30 of MS. Aubr. 9 is another draft of this
paragraph:--'He had an elder brother, Francis Hobbes, a wealthy man,
and had been alderman of the borough' (dupl. with 'towne'); 'by
profession a glover, which is a great trade here and was heretofore
greater. He was _orbus_. He contributed much, or altogether maintained
his nephew Thomas at Magdalen Hall in Oxon; and when he dyed gave him
an _agellum_ (vocat. "the Gasten"), which lyes neer the horse faire:
valet per annum 16 _li._ vel 18 _li._'

[FI] (P. 324.) Anthony Wood notes:--'Quaere in the register of
Brakenborough when they were maried and their you'l find her Christian
name.'--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 30ᵛ.

[FJ] (P. 326.) In MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 31ᵛ, Anthony Wood suggests the
following paragraph for the transition from the account of Malmsbury to
the life of Hobbes:--

'As Malmsbury was famous in this respect that it gave death and buriall
to that famous philosopher of his time Johannes Scotus _alias_ Erigina
who was stabd to death with penknives by his scholars, where there was
a statue set up in memory of him (ut in _Hist. et Antiq. Oxon._ lib. 1,
pag. 16 _b_), so much more famous in later times for the birth of that
great philosopher T. H.'

In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 28, Aubrey begins his sketch of Hobbes' life
thus:--'Westport juxta Malmesbury:--This place is for nothing so famous
as for the birth of my honoured and learned friend and countryman, Mr.
Thomas Hobbes, author of _de Corpore_, _de Homine_, _de Cive_, etc.

He was borne the 5th day of Aprill 1588 at his father's howse, which is
the farthest on the left hand as you goe in the way or street called
..., leaving the church on the right hand.'

[FK] (P. 326.) The verses alluded to are in Hobbes's metrical life of
himself (MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 28--'he writt his life last yeare, viz.
1673, in Latin verse'). Aubrey cites these lines, MS. Aubr. 9, fol.
31ᵛ:--

                         'T.H. _Vita_ in verse

    Oppidulum parvum est; habuit sed multa relatu
      Digna, sed imprimis Coenobium celebre,
    Et castrum (melius nisi sint dua castra vocanda)
      Colle sita, et bino flumine cincta fere.

Vide mapp' <perhaps Speed's map of Wiltshire: but on a slip at fol.
31ᵛ, Aubrey gives a 'map' of Malmesbury: see _supra_, pp. 325, 326>.

On this Anthony Wood comments: 'See 1 vol. of _Monast. Anglican._
concerning the monastery.'

[FL] (P. 326.) The matter of this paragraph is put a little more
clearly in MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 28: 'Westport juxta Malmesbury:--The
church was dedicated to St. Mary. Here were three aisles[1673] which
tooke up the whole area. And <the church was> reported to be more
ancient then the abbey. In the windowes (which were very good) were
inscriptions which declared so much. Quaere, if Madulph the Scottsman
taught here--unde origo monasterii? Vide Camdenum de hoc.

Before the late warres here was a prettie church, where were very good
windowes and a faire steeple, higher than the other, which much adorned
the towne of Malmesbury. In it were five tuneable bells, which Sir
William Waller or his army melted into ordinance, or rather sold. The
church was pulled downe that the enimie might not shelter themselves
against the garrison of Malmesbury.'

[FM] (P. 328.) Aubrey's _Collection of Genitures_ is now MS. Aubr. 23.
The place Aubrey here refers to is fol. 52ᵛ in that MS., viz.:--

'Mr. Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury borne at Westport juxta Malmesbury
1588, April 5, being Good Fryday, 5ʰ 2´ mane, horâ solis' <i.e. at
sunrise>. 'I had the yeare, and day, and houre from his owne mouth.'

Aubrey in several places recurs to this point, e.g. in MS. Aubr. 3,
fol. 28:--

'Mr. Thomas Hobbes told me that he was borne Apr. 5ᵗʰ 1588 on Good
Fryday, in the morning between 4 and six.'

[FN] (P. 328.) Aubrey took great interest in this as an example in
astrology, in which 'art' he thoroughly believed. He alludes to
Hobbes's horoscope in several places, e.g. note on fol. 32ᵛ in MS.
Aubr. 9:--

'Dr. <Francis> Bernard, physitian, will write a discourse on his
nativity. Mr. John Gadbury hath calculated this nativity from my time
given, and will print it. Why should not I insert' <dupl. with 'print'>
'the scheme and give a summary of his judgement? It would be gratefull
to those that love that art.' Whereon Anthony Wood notes--'You should
never ask these questions but do them out of hand forthwith--you have
time enough, and if it be done by Easter terme 'tis well.'

MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 28:--'<Send> to Mr. J. Gadbury and Dr. Bernard <T.
H.'s> accidents.'

MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 8:--'T. Hobbes--Quaere Dr. Bernard pro his nativity:
vide my Collection of Genitures ubi from his owne mouth more correct
then formerly, viz. 5ʰ 2´ mane.'

This horoscope is given in MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 82, and is reproduced in
facsimile at the end of this edition.

Pasted on to fol. 1ᵛ of MS. Aubr. 9 is the scheme with this
note:--'This scheme was erected according to the aestimate time by
Mr. Henry Coley, astrologer.--Thomas Hobbes, Malmesburiensis, borne
at Westport juxta Malmesbury, 1588, April 5, being Good Fryday, 5ʰ 2´
mane, hora solis[1674]. I had the yeare and day and houre from his owne
mouth.'

[FO] (P. 328.) In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 26, thus:--'At fower yeer old Mr.
Thomas Hobbes went to schoole in Westport church till 8--then[1675] the
church was painted. At 8 he could read well and number a matter of four
or five figures.

After, he went to Malmesbury to parson Evans.

After him, he had for his schoolemaster, Mr. Robert Latimer[CXXIX.],
a good Graecian; by whom he so well profited that at 14 yeares old he
went a good scholler to Magdalen Hall in Oxford.'

[CXXIX.] Who being a bachelor (not above 19) taught him and two or
three more ingeniose laddes after supper till 9.

[FP] (P. 330.) As seen in the next paragraph, there was some doubt as
to which 'Principal of Magdalen Hall' recommended Hobbes to the earl of
Devonshire's service. In MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 29, is the note:--

'Take notice of Dr. Blackburne's altering some times and dates,' <in
Hobbes' prose Latin life of himself, prefixed to the _Auctarium vitae
Hobbianae_> 'differing from this originall, e.g. of Mr. Hobbes being
admitted at Magdalen Hall when Sir James Hussey was principall, which
he would doe against my consent because he sayd it "would make a better
picture," wheras by the matriculation-booke it appeares that Dr.
Wilkinson was then the principall.'

[FQ] (P. 331.) On fol. 34ᵛ of MS. Aubr. 9, Aubrey has the following
account of Gorhambury:--

'Memorandum in my Liber B[1675]. I have sett downe an exact description
of this delicious parquet[1676], now (1656) plowed up and spoil'd.
The east part of it which extends towards Verulam-house (pulled
downe, and the materialls sold by Sir H<arbottle> Grimston, about
ten yeares since) consisted of severall parts, viz. some thickets
of plumme-trees, with fine walkes between; some of rasberies. Here
were planted most fruit-trees which would grow in our climate; and
also severall choice forest-trees. The walkes both of boscages and
fruit-trees; and in severall places where were the best prospects, were
built elegant summerhouses[1677] of Roman architecture, then standing
(1656) well[1678] wainscotted, but the paving gonne. One would have
thought the most barbarous nation had made a conquest here. This place
was, in his lordship's time, a sanctuary for phesants, partridges,
and those of severall kinds and nations, as Spanish, &c. speckled,
white, etc. I have, in this lib. B., four leves in fol. close written
of the two houses, gardens, woods, &c. and of his lordship's manner of
living and grandarie, which perhaps would doe well in a description of
Hartfordshire, or, perhaps[1679], in his lordship's life.'

[FR] (P. 332.) In MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 1ᵛ, is this note:--'Dr. <John>
Pell says that for a man to begin to study mathematics at 40 yeares
old, 'tis as if one should at that age learne to play on the
lute--applicable to Mr. Thomas Hobbes. Vide vitam Jonae Moore.'

[FS] (P. 338.) In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 26, thus:--

'Memorandum:--about the time of the King's returne[CXXX.], he was
makeing of a very good poëme in Latin hexameters. It was the history of
the encroachment of the clergie (both Roman and Reformed) on the civill
power. I sawe at least 300 verses (they were mark't). At what time
there was a report the bishops would have him burn't for a heretique.
So he then feared the search of his papers and burned the greatest part
of these verses.'

[CXXX.] Quaere in what yeares his bookes were writ.

[FT] (P. 339.) The first draft of this passage stood as follows,
MS. Aubr. 9, foll. 40, 41:--'In April following was the dawning of
the coming in of our gracious soveraigne, who being a great lover
of curious painting I knew could not but sett for his picture to my
ever honoured friend Mr. S. Cowper, who[1680] besides his art was an
ingeniose person and of great humanity. In April I wrott a letter to
Mr. Hobbes in Derbyshire, by all meanes desiring him to come-up and
make use of the opportunity of renewing his majestie's graces to him at
our friend's howse. He thanked me for'--etc.

[FU] (P. 341.) Aubrey, writing to Wood, on Feb. 3, 1672/3, enlarges on
this treatise: Wood MS. F. 39, fol. 196ᵛ:--

'The old gent. (T. Hobbes) is strangely vigorous, for his
understanding, still; and every morning walkes abroad to meditate.

'He haz writt a treatise concerning lawe, which 8 or 9 yeares since
I much importuned him to doe, and, in order to it, gave him the Lord
Chancellor Bacon's _Maximes of the Lawe_. Now every one will doe him
the right to acknowledge he is rare for definitions, and the lawyers
building on old-fashiond maximes (some right, some wrong) must need
fall into severall paralogismes. Upon this consideration I was earnest
with him to consider these things. To which he was unwilling, telling
me he doubted he should not have dayes enough left to doe it.

'He drives on, in this, the king's prerogative high. Judge <Sir
Matthew> Hales, who is no great courtier, has read it and much mislikes
it, and is his enemy. Judge Vaughan has read it and much commends it.'

[FV] (P. 355.) Note, however, that on some of the letters from Hobbes
in MS. Aubr. 9, viz., those of date March 25, 1679 (fol. 11ᵛ, fol.
13ᵛ), and that of date Aug. 18, 1679 (fol. 15ᵛ), the seal shows a gate
or portcullis, with an R turned backwards, i.e. Я, on the left side of
it.

James Wheldon's letter of Jan. 16, 1679/80 (fol. 17ᵛ), has a seal
bearing a man's bust, with helmet and cuirass.

[FW] (P. 357.) In MS. Aubr. 21, p. 19, Aubrey, in his projected comedy,
makes use of this verdict on the innate cruelty of some dispositions.
He puts into the mouth of his country-justice this speech:--

"If ye talke of skinnes, the best judgment to be made of the fineness
of skinnes is at the whipping-post by the stripes. Ah! 'tis the best
lechery to see 'em suffer correction. Your London aldermen take great
lechery to see the poor wretches whipt at the court at Bridewell."

On which Aubrey goes on to comment: 'Old Justice Hooke gave ...
per lash to wenches; as also my old friend George Pott, esq. Vide
Animadversions Philosophicall on that ugly kind of pleasure and of
crueltie--were it not for the law there were no living; some would take
delight in killing of men.'

[FX] (P. 375.) The substance is:--

'Hobbes brought to the investigation of facts an acute intellect and
long experience, and carried on, into the next generation, the Baconian
spirit.

'He had been Bacon's secretary, and owed much to his master, from whom,
in particular, he borrowed his comparative, i.e. inductive, methods.
But he had also fine natural gifts.

'He excited the fears, and therefore the hostility, of the clerical
party in England, and of the Oxford mathematicians and their
supporters. For this reason, Charles II compared him to a bear, worried
by mastiffs.

'In his political system, he insisted on the necessity of wisdom in
sovereigns. In not meddling with the Creeds of the Churches and in
assailing the Presbyterians and the Bishops of England, he is not to be
blamed.'

    Note that, on fol. 42ᵛ of MS. Aubr. 9, is a note 'to the earl
    of Devon, then in Great Queen Street,' with a mark referring it
    to the opposite page. The then opposite page is, in the present
    foliation, fol. 48, but has now nothing to which the note can
    be attached. There are traces, however, which show that a slip
    has been torn off it.




=Thomas Hobbes' life, by himself.=


<_Aubrey's preface._>

[1681]This was the draught that Mr. Hobbs first did leave in my hands,
which he sent for about two yeares before he died, and wrote that which
is printed in his Life in Latin by Dr. Richard Blackburn which I lent
to him and he was carelesse and not remaunded it from the printer and
so 'twas made wast paper of.


<_Hobbes' autobiography._>

[1682]Thomas Hobbes, natus Apr. 5, 1588, Malmesburiae agri
Wiltoniensis, literis Latinis et Graecis initiatus, annum agens decimum
quartum missus est Oxonium: ubi per quinquennium mansit, operam
impendens studio Logicae et Physicae Aristotelicae.

Cum annum ageret vicesimum commendatus ab amicis, Oxonio relicto,
recepit se in domum domini Gulielmi Cavendish, baronis de Hardwick et
(paulo post) comitis Devoniae: ubi filio ejus primogenito, adolescenti
sibi fere coaetaneo, servivit, placuitque tum filio tum patri,
temperans, sedulus, hilaris.

Anno sequente cum domino suo in urbe perpetuo fere degens, quod
didicerat linguae Graecae et Latinae magna ex parte amiserat.

Deinde per Italiam et Galliam peregrinantem dominum sequutus, gentium
illarum linguas eousque didicit ut intelligere eas mediocriter
potuerit. Interea Graecam et Latinam paulatim perire sibi sentiens,
Philosophiam autem Logicamque (in quibus praeclare profecisse se
arbitrabatur) viris prudentibus derisui esse videns, abjecta Logica
et Philosophia illa vana, quantum temporis habebat vacui impendere
decrevit linguis Graecae et Latinae.

Itaque cum in Angliam reversus esset, Historias et Poetas (adhibitis
grammaticorum celebrium commentariis) versavit diligenter, non ut
floride sed ut Latine posset scribere, et vim verborum cogitatis
congruentem invenire, itaque verba disponere ut lectio perspicua et
facilis esset. Inter Historias Graecas, Thucididem prae caeteris
dilexit et vacuis horis in sermonem Anglicum paulatim conversum cum
nonnullâ laude circa annum Christi 1628 in publicum edidit, eo fine ut
ineptiae democraticorum Atheniensium concivibus suis patefierent.

Eo anno comes Devoniae, cui jam servierat viginti annos, diem obiit,
patre ejus biennio ante defuncto.

Anno sequente, qui erat Christi 1629, cum attigisset annum
quadragesimum, rogatus a nobilissimo viro domino Gervasio Clinton
ut vellet filium adolescentem suum comitari in Galliam, accepit
conditionem. In peregrinatione illa inspicere coepit in elementa
Euclidis; et delectatus methodo illius non tam ob theoremata illa quam
ob artem rationandi diligentissime perlegit.

Anno Christi 1631 revocatus est in familiam comitissae Devoniae ut
filium suum comitem Devoniae, natum annos 13, in literis instrueret;
quem etiam circiter triennium post comitatus est in Galliam et Italiam,
studiorum ejus et itinerum rector.

Dum moraretur Parisiis, principia scientiae naturalis investigare
coepit. Quae cum in natura et varietate motuum contineri sciret,
quaesivit inprimis qualis motus is esse posset qui efficit sensionem,
intellectum, phantasmata, aliasque proprietates animalium, cogitatis
suis cum reverendo patre Marino Mersenno, ordinis Minimorum, in omni
genere philosophiae versatissimo viroque optimo, quotidie communicatis.

Anno Christi 1637 cum patrono suo in Angliam rediit et apud illum
mansit; unde de rebus naturalibus commercia cum Mersenno per literas
continuavit.

Interea Scoti, depulsis episcopis, sumpserunt arma contra regem,
faventibus etiam ministris Anglis illis qui vocari solent
Presbyteriani. Itaque convocatum est in Anglia Parlamentum illud
notissimum quod inceptum est Nov. 3, 1640. Ex iis quae in illo
Parlamento tribus quatuorve diebus primis consulta viderat, Bellum
Civile ingruere et tantum non adesse sentiens, retulit se rursus in
Galliam, scientiarum studio Parisiis tutius vacaturus cum Mersenno,
Gassendo, aliisque viris propter eruditionem et vim in rationando
celeberrimis--non enim dico philosophis, quia nomen illud, a plurimis
nebulonibus jamdiu gestatum, tritum, inquinatum, nunc infame est.

Cum jam Parisiis ageret, libellum scripsit _De Cive_, quem edidit
anno 1646, quo tempore, praevalentibus Parlamentariis, multi eorum
qui partes regis sequuti erant, et in illis princeps Walliae (qui
nunc est rex Angliae), Parisiis confluxerunt. Statuerat circa idem
tempus,[1683]hortatu amici cujusdam nobilis Languedociani, migrare
in Languedociam, et praemiserat jam quae sibi necessaria erant, sed
commendatus principi ut elementa Mathematicae illi praelegeret,
substit<it> Parisiis.

Quod ab hoc munere temporis habuit vacui consumpsit in scribendo
librum qui nunc non solum in Anglia sed in vicinis gentibus notissimus
est, nomine _Leviathan_; quem etiam in Anglia edendum curavit, ipse
manens adhuc Parisiis, anno 1651, annum agens 63ᵐ. In eo opere jus
regium tum spirituale tum temporale ita demonstravit tum rationibus
tum authoritate scripturae sacrae, ut perspicuum fecerit pacem in
orbe Christiano nusquam diuturnam esse posse nisi vel doctrina illa
sua recepta fuerit vel satis magnus exercitus cives ad concordiam
compulerit: opus ut ille sperabat concivibus suis, praesertim vero
illis qui ab episcopis steterant, non ingratum. Quanquam enim
unicuique, illo tempore, scribere et edere theologica quae vellet
liberum erat, quia regimen ecclesiae (potestate declarandi quae
doctrinae essent haereses, ipsius regis authoritate sublata, episcopis
exutis, rege ipso trucidato) tum nullum erat, diligenter tamen cavit
ne quid scriberet non modo contra sensum scripturae sacrae sed etiam
contra doctrinam ecclesiae Anglicanae qualis ante bellum ortum
authoritate regia constituta fuerat. Nam et ipse regimen ecclesiae per
episcopos prae caeteris formis omnibus semper approbaverat, atque hoc
duobus signis manifestum fecit. Primo, cum in oppido Sti. Germani prope
Parisios morbo gravissimo lecto affixus esset, venit ad eum Mersennus,
rogatus a quodam amico communi ne amicum suum extra ecclesiam Romanam
mori pateretur. Is lecto assidens (post exordium consolatorium) de
potestate ecclesiae Romanae peccata remittendi aliquantisper disseruit,
cui ille 'Mi pater,' inquit. 'haec omnia jamdudum mecum disputavi,
eadem disputare nunc molestum erit: habes quod dicas amoeniora,--quando
vidisti Gassendum?' Quibus auditis, Mersennus sermonem ad alia
transtulit. Paucis post diebus accessit ad illum Dr. Johannes Cosenus,
episcopus (post) Dunelmensis, obtulitque se illi comprecatorem ad
Deum. Cui ille cum gratias reddidisset, 'Ita,' inquit, 'si precibus
praeiveris juxta ritum ecclesiae nostrae.' Magnum hoc erga disciplinam
episcopalem signum erat reverentiae.

Anno 1651 exemplaria aliquot illius libri, Londini recens editi, in
Galliam transmissa sunt, ubi theologi quidam Angli doctrinas quasdam
in illo libro contentas, tum ut haereticas tum ut partibus regiis
adversas, criminati sunt; et valuere quidem aliquamdiu calumniae
illae in tantum ut domo regia prohibitus fuerit. Quo factum est ut,
protectione regia destitutus, metuensque ne a clericis Romanis, quos
praecipue laeserat, male tractaretur, in Angliam conatus sit refugere.

Rediens in Angliam concionantes quidem invenit in ecclesiis sed
seditiosos; etiam preces extemporarias, et illas audaces et nonnunquam
blasphemas; symbolum autem fidei nullum, decalogum nullum; adeo ut
per tres primos menses non invenerit quibuscum in sacris communicare
potuerit. Tandem ab amico ductus ad ecclesiam a suo hospitio[1684]
plusquam mille passus distantem ubi pastor erat vir bonus et doctus,
qui et coenam Domini ritu ecclesiastico administravit, cum illo
in sacris communicavit. Alterum hoc signum erat non modo hominis
partium episcopalium sed etiam Christiani sinceri; nam illo tempore
ad ecclesiam quamcunque legibus aut metu cogebatur nemo. Quae igitur
episcopo cuiquam cum illo causa irae esse potuit, nisi ei qui neminem a
se dissentire pati per superbiam posset?

Interea doctrinam ejus academici et ecclesiastici condemnabant fere
omnes; laudabant nobiles, et viri docti, ex laicis. Refellebat nemo:
conati refellere, confirmabant. Scripsit enim non ex auditione et
lectione ut scholaris, sed ex judicio proprio cognita et pensitata
omnia, sermone puro et perspicuo, non rhetorico. Stantem inter amicos
et inimicos quasi in aequilibrio, fecerunt illi ne ob doctrinam
opprimeretur, hi, ne augeretur. Itaque fortuna tenui, fama doctrinae
ingenti, in patroni sui, comitis Devoniae, hospitio per caeterum vitae
tempus perpetuo delituit, studio vacans geometriae et philosophiae
naturalis; ediditque jam senex librum quendam quem inscripsit _De
Corpore_, continentem Logicae, Geometriae, Physicae (tum sublunaris,
tum coelestis) fundamenta, deducens Logicam quidem a significatione
nominum, Geometriam autem et Physicam ex figurarum et effectuum
naturalium generationibus.

Hominis ergo neque genere neque opibus neque negotiis belli aut
pacis assueti vitam scribo et in publicum emitto, sed in omni
genere scientiae excellentis et fere singularis. Cujus ingenium ut
cognoscerent, partim etiam ut sua ostentarent, convenerunt <ad> eum
viri innumeri tum nostrates tum exteri, et inter illos nonnulli legati
principum aliique viri nobilissimi; adeo ut conjectura inde facta de
voluntate hominum eruditorum qui posthac erunt, non ingratum fore
posteritati existimavi si quem vidisse voluerunt illius vitam literis
posteritati tradiderim, praecipue quidem ut quae scientiis ille primus
addidit, deinde etiam caetera vitae ejus quae a lectoribus desiderari
posse videbuntur cognoscerent.

Quae scripsit de jure naturali, de constitutione civitatum, de jure
eorum qui summam habent potestatem, et de officiis civium, in libris
_Leviathan_ et _De Cive_ (quia domi forisque nota et maxime celebrata
sunt) praetereunda censeo.

In Physicis causam sensuum, praecipue visus, una cum doctrina
omni optica et natura lucis, refractionis reflectionisque causas
naturales, ignotas ante, primus demonstravit, in libro _De Homine_.
Item causas qualitatum sensibilium nimirum colorum, soni, caloris, et
frigoris. Somnia autem et phantasmata quae antea pro spiritibus et
mortuorum animis habebantur et rudi vulgo terriculamenta erant, omnia
profligavit. Causam autem aestuum marinorum et descensionis gravium,
a motu quodam telluris praecipue derivavit. Nam phaenomena illa omnia
ad motum refert, non ad rerum ipsarum potentias intrinsecas neque ad
qualitates occultas, ut ante illum omnes physici. De motu autem in
libro _De Corpore_ satis fuse scripsit et profundissime. In Ethicis
ante illum nihil scriptum est praeter sententias vulgares. At ille
mores hominum ab humana natura, virtutes et vitia a lege naturali, et
bonitatem[1685] maliciamque actionum a legibus civitatum, derivavit.
In Mathematicis principia geometriae nonnulla correxit; problemata
aliquot difficillima, a summis geometris (ab ipsis geometriae
incunabulis) summo studio frustra quaesita, invenit, nimirum haec--

1º. arcui circuli lineam rectam, areae circuli quadratum aequale,
exhibere, idque variis methodis--in diversis libris.

2º. datum angulum dividere in data ratione;

3º. cubi ad sphaeram rationem invenire--in _Problematibus Geometricis_.

4º. inter duas rectas datas medias continue proportionales invenire
quotcunque--in _Problematibus Geometricis_.

5º. polygonum regulare describere quotcunque laterum--in _Roseto_.

6º. centrum gravitatis invenire quadrantis circuli et bilinei quod
continetur arcu quadrantis et subtenta ejus--in _Roseto_.

7º. centra gravitatis invenire paraboli-formium omnium, in libra _De
Corpore_.

Haec omnia primus construxit et demonstravit, et praeterea alia multa
quae (quia legentibus occurrent et minoris sunt) praetereo.

Facient opinor haec ut vita ejus non indigna videatur quae tum ad
exteros tum ad posteros scientiarum studiosos transmittatur, praesertim
hoc tempore, cum scribuntur vulgo vitae obscurorum hominum nulla
virtute insignium, desiderante nemine.

Scripsit praeterea, circa annum aetatis suae octagesimum, historiam
belli civilis Anglicani inter regem Carolum primum et parlamentum ejus,
anno ...; item ortum et incrementa potestatis pontificiae, carmine
Latino, versuum duûm millium, sed non sinebant tempora ut publicarentur.

Silentibus tandem adversariis, annum agens octagesimum, <pri>mum,
Homeri Odyssea edidit a se conversum in versus Anglicanos, ...; deinde,
proximo, etiam Iliada; denique Cyclometriam, annum agens <...>gessimum
primum, integram nondum editam.

Quod ad formam attinet, vultu erat non specioso sed cum loqueretur non
ingrato. Effigies ejus ad vivum a pictore excellente descripta, qualis
erat anno aetatis suae septuagesimo, in conclavi regis Caroli secundi
conservatur. Extant etiam ejusdem imagines ab aliis pictoribus diversis
temporibus factae rogatu amicorum in Anglia non paucae et in Gallia
aliquot.

Natura sua et primis annis ferebatur ad lectionem historiarum et
poetarum; et ipse quoque carmen tentavit, nec (ut plurimi judicabant)
infoeliciter. Postea autem cum in congressu quodam virorum doctorum,
mentione facta de causa sensionis, quaerentem unum quasi per contemptum
'quid esset sensus?' nec quemquam audivisset respondentem, mirabatur
quî fieri potuerit ut qui sapientiae titulo homines caeteros tanto
fastu despicerent suos ipsorum sensus quid essent ignorarent. Ex eo
tempore de causa sentiendi saepe cogitanti, forte fortunâ mentem subiit
quod si res corporeae et earum partes omnes conquiescerent aut motu
simili semper moverentur[1686]sublatum iri omnium rerum discrimen et
(per consequens) omnem sentionem, et propterea causam omnium rerum
quaerendam esse in diversitate motuum: atque hoc principio usus est
primo. Deinde, ut cognosceret varietates et rationes motuum, ad
geometriam cogebatur, et a principiis suis ingenio suo theoremata
illa quae supra commemoravi foeliciter demonstravit. Tantum interest
inter illos qui proprio genio et illos qui in archivis veterum aut ad
quaestum docentium scientiarum veritatem quaerunt.

In colloquiis familiaribus jucundus erat, praeterquam illorum qui
ad illum venerant disputandi causa contra ea quae jam ediderat
(nec revocari poterant) de jure summarum potestatum civili aut
ecclesiastico; nam cum his vehementius aliquando disputabat quam erat
necessarium.

Naturaliter apertus erat, et inter adversarios qui multi potentesque
erant innocentia magis quam consilio tutus.

Justiciae erat cum scientissimus, tum tenacissimus. Nec mirum, cum
esset pecuniae neglegentissimus, et pro tenuitate fortunarum suarum
ultra modum beneficus. Sed beneficio patronorum suorum et regis optimi
dulcissimique Caroli secundi satis copiose senex vixit.




=William Holder= (1616-1697/8).


[1687]William Holder[FY], D.D., the ...d son[1688] of ... Holder;
his mother's mayden name was Brudenell. He was borne the ... in
Nottinghamshire; went to schoole at ...; went to Pembroke-hall[1689] in
Cambridge, where he had a Greeke-scholar's place. Anno <1636/7>, Artium
Baccalaureus; anno <1640> Artium Magister.

About 1640, he maried ... the ... daughter of <Christopher> Wren, deane
of Windsore and rector of Knowyll in Wiltshire.

Anno Domini 1642, had his institution and induction for the rectorie of
Bletchington in com. Oxon.

In the troublesome times he was with his father-in-lawe Wren at the
garrison of Bristowe. After the surrender of it to the Parliament, he
lived ... year at Knowyll with him.

Anno about 1646[1690], he went to Bletchington to his parsonage,
where his hospitality and learning, mixt with great courtesie, easily
conciliated the love of all his neighbours to him. The deane came with
him thither, and dyed and is buryed there.

He was very helpfull in the education of his brother-in-law, Mr.
Christopher Wren (now knighted), a youth of a prodigious inventive
witt, and of whom he was as tender as if he had been his owne
child, who[1691] gave him his first instructions in geometrie and
arithmetique, and when he was a young scholar at the University of
Oxford, was a very necessary and kind friend.

The parsonage-house at Bletchington was Mr. Christopher Wren's home,
and retiring-place; here he contemplated, and studied, and found-out
a great many curious things in mathematiques. About this house[1692]
he made severall curious dialls, with his owne handes, which are still
there to be seen. ☞ Which see, as well worthy to be seen.

But to returne to this honest worthy gentleman--he is a good poet. I
have some very good verses (about 100) in Latin on St. Vincent's-rocks
and the hott-well, neere Bristowe. He is very musicall, both
theorically and practically, and he had a sweet voyce. He hath writt an
excellent treatise of musique, in English, which is writt both _doctis
et indoctis_, and readie for the presse. He is extremely well qualified
for his[1693]place, of Sub-Deane of the King's Chapell, to which he was
preferred[1694] anno 167<4>, as likewise of the Sub-Almoner, being a
person abhorring covetousnes, and full of pitty[1695].

Anno 16--(vide his ...) ... Popham (the only son of ... Popham,
admirall for the Parliament), being borne deafe and dumbe[1696], was
sent to him to learne to speake, which he taught him to doe: by what
method, and how soon, you may see in the Appendix concerning it to
his _Elements of Speech_, 8vo, London, printed <1669>. It is a most
ingeniose and curious discourse, and untouched by any other; he was
beholding to no author; did only consult with nature. This booke I
sent to Mr. Anthony Lucas, at Liege, who very much admires it and I
have desired him to translate it into French. Dr. John Wallis unjustly
arrogates the glory of teaching the sayd young gentleman to speake, in
the Philosophical Transactions, and in Dr. Robert Plott's History of
Oxfordshire; which occasioned Dr. Holder to write a ... against him, a
pamphlet in 4to, 167-.

He has good judgement in painting and drawing.

In anno <1652> he was made a prebendary of Ely. Anno <1663> had the
parsonage of <Northwold> in Norfolk.

He is a handsome, gracefull person, and of a delicate constitution,
and of an even and smooth temper; so that, if one would goe about to
describe a perfect good man, would drawe this Doctor's character.
Of a just stature; grey eie; tall and well-sett; sanguine; thin
skin; roundish face; gracefull elocution; his discourse so gent. and
obligeing; cleer reason.

They say that _morum similitudo conci<li>at amicitiam_; then it will
not be found strange that there should be such a conjunct friendship
between this worthy gentleman and the right reverend father in God,
Seth Ward, lord bishop of Sarum, his coetanean in Cambridge.

It ought not to be forgott the great and exemplary love between this
Doctor and his vertuose wife, who is not lesse to be admired, in her
sex and station, then her brother Sir Christopher; and (which is
rare to be found in a woman) her excellences doe not inflate her.
Amongst many other guifts she haz a strange sagacity as to curing
of wounds, which she does not doe so much by presedents and reciept
bookes, as by her owne excogitancy, considering the causes, effects,
and circumstances. His majestie king Charles II, 167-, had hurt his
... hand, which he intrusted his chirurgians to make well; but they
ordered him so that they made it much worse, so that it swoll, and
pained him up to his shoulder; and pained him so extremely that he
could not sleep, and began to be feaverish. ... told the king what a
rare shee-surgeon he had in his house; she was presently sent for at
eleven clock at night. She presently made ready a pultisse, and applyed
it, and gave his majestie sudden ease, and he slept well; next day she
dressed him, and in ... perfectly cured him, to the great griefe of all
the surgeons, who envy and hate her.

    Non Illo melior quisquam, nec amantior aequi
    Vir fuit: aut Illâ reverentior ulla Deorum.

[FY] Aubrey gives the coat, 'sable, a chevron between 3 anchors
argent.' Anthony Wood adds the reference 'vide pag. 65 _a_,' i.e. fol.
95, of MS. Aubr. 6, in the life of John Wallis.




=Hugh Holland= (15-- -1633).


[1697]From Sir John Penrudock:--Hugh Holland, poeta: he was descended
of the family of the earles of Kent, etc., and was a Roman Catholique.
The lady Elizabeth Hatton (mother to the lady Purb<ec>) was his great
patronesse (vide B. Jonson's masque of the Gipsies for these two
beauties).

Sir J<ohn> P<enrudock> asked him his advice as he was dyeing, (or he
then gave it) that, the best rule for him to governe his life was to
reade St. Hierome's Epistles.

He was buried in Westminster Abbey[1698], in the south crosse aisle
neer the dore of St. Benet's Chapell, i.e. where the earl of Middlesex
monument is, but there is no monument or inscription for him. He was
buryed July 23, 1633.

He was of a Lancashire family.

Tho. Holland, earl of Kent (his sonnes, dukes of Surrey), tempore Rich.

=Philemon Holland= (1551-1637).


[1699]Philêmon Holland was schoole-master of the free-schoole at
Coventrey, and that for many yeares. He made a great many good
scholars. He translated T. Livius, anno 15--, with one and the
same pen, which the lady ... (vide at the end of his translation
of Suetonius) embellished with silver, and kept amongst her rare
κειμηλια[1700]. He wrote a good hand, but a rare Greeke character;
witnesse the MS. of Euclid's Harmoniques in the library belonging to
the schoole. He translated severall Latin authors,--e.g. Tit. Livius,
Plinii Hist. Natur., Suetonius Tranquillus: quaere +.

One made this epigram on him:--

'Philêmon with 's translations doeth so fill us, He will not let
SUETONIUS be TRANQUILLUS.'




=Wenceslaus Hollar= (1607-1677).


[1701]Winceslaus Hollar, natus Pragae 23 Julii, st<ilo> v<etere>, 1607,
about 8 A.M.

[1702]Winceslaus Hollar, Bohemus, was borne at Prague.

His father was a Knight of the Empire: which is by lettres patent
under the imperiall seale (as our baronets). I have seen it[1703]:
the seale is bigger then the broad seale of England: in the middle
is the imperiall coate; and round about it are the coates of the
Princes Electors. His father was a Protestant, and either for keeping
a conventicle, or being taken at one, forfeited his estate, and was
ruined by the Roman Catholiques.

He told me that when he was a schoole-boy he tooke a delight in
draweing of mapps; which draughts he kept, and they were pretty. He
was designed by his father to have been a lawyer, and was putt to that
profession[1704], when his father's troubles, together with the warres,
forced him to leave his countrey. So that what he did for his delight
and recreation only when a boy, proved to be his livelyhood when a man.

I thinke he stayd sometime in Lowe Germany, then he came into England,
wher he was very kindly entertained by that great patron of painters
and draughts-men <Thomas Howard> Lord High Marshall, earl of Arundell
and Surrey, where he spent his time in draweing and copying rarities,
which he did etch (i.e. eate with aqua fortis in copper plates). When
the Lord Marshall went ambassador to the Emperor of Germany to Vienna,
he travelld with much grandeur; and among others, Mr. Hollar went
with him (very well clad) to take viewes, landskapes, buildings, etc.
remarqueable in their journey, which wee see now at the print shopps.

He hath donne the most in that way that ever any one did, insomuch that
I have heard Mr. John Evelyn, R.S.S., say that at sixpence a print
his labour would come to ... _li._ (quaere J<ohn> E<velyn>). He was
very short-sighted (μυοψ[1705]), and did worke so curiously that the
curiosity of his worke is not to be judged without a magnifying-glasse.
When he tooke his landskaps, he, then, had a glasse to helpe his sight.

At Arundel-house he maried with my ladle's wayting woman, Mrs. ...
Tracy, by whom he haz a daughter, that was one of the greatest beauties
I have seen; his son by her dyed in the plague, an ingeniose youth,
drew delicately.

When the civil warres brake-out, the Lord Marshall had leave to goe
beyond sea[CXXXI.]. Mr. Hollar went into the Lowe-Countries, where he
stayed till about 1649.

[CXXXI.] Italie[1706].

I remember he told me that when he first came into England, (which was
a serene time of peace) that the people, both poore and rich, did looke
cheerfully, but at his returne, he found the countenances of the people
all changed, melancholy, spightfull, as if bewitched.

I have sayd before that his father was ruined upon the account of the
Protestant religion. Winceslaus dyed a Catholique, of which religion, I
suppose, he might be ever since he came to Arundel-howse.

He was a very friendly good-natured man as could be, but shiftlesse as
to the world, and dyed not rich[1707]. He maried a second wife, 1665,
by whom he has severall children. He dyed on our Ladie-day (25 Martii),
1677, and is buried in St. Margaret's church-yard at Westminster neer
the north west corner of the tower. Had he lived till the 13th of July
following, he had been just 70 yeares old.




=John Holywood= (11-- -1256).


[1708]Jo. de Sacro Bosco:--Dr. <John> Pell is positive that his name
was Holybushe.




=Thomas Hoode.=


[1709]... Hood, M.D.--he practised Physick at Worcester, and printed a
booke in 4to called _The Geodeticall Staffe_[1710].




=Robert Hooke= (1635-1703).


[1711]Mr. Robert Hooke, curator of the Royall Societie at London, was
borne at Freshwater in the Isle of Wight, A.D. <1635>; his father was
minister there, and of the family of the Hookes of Hooke in Hants.

[1712]July 19ᵗʰ, 1635, baptized Robert Hooke, the son of Mr. John Hooke.

[1713]Mr. Robert Hooke[FZ], M.A.:--his father, Mr. John Hooke,[1714]had
two or three brothers all ministers: quaere Dr. <William> Holder. He
was of the family of Hooke of Hooke in Hampshire, in the road from
London to Saram, a very ancient family and in that place for many (3 or
more) hundred yeares.

[1715]His father was minister of Freshwater in the Isle of Wight. He
maried ... ..., by whom he had two sonnes, viz. ... of Newport, grocer
(quaere capt. Lee) and had been mayer there, and Robert, second son,
who was borne[1716] at Freshwater aforesayd the nineteenth day of July,
Anno Domini 1635--vide register, et obiit patris.

At ... yeares old, John Hoskyns, the painter, being at Freshwater, to
drawe pictures for ... esqre, Mr. Hooke observed what he did, and,
thought he, 'why cannot I doe so too?' So he getts him chalke, and
ruddle, and coale, and grinds them, and putts them on a trencher,
gott a pencill, and to worke he went, and made a picture: then he
copied[1717] (as they hung up in the parlour) the pictures there, which
he made like. Also, being a boy there, at Freshwater, he made an ...
diall on a round trencher; never having had any instruction. His father
was not mathematicall at all.

When his father dyed, his son Robert was but ... old, to whom he left
one hundred pounds, which was sent up to London with him, with an
intention to have bound him apprentice to Mr. Lilly[1718], the paynter,
with whom he was a little while upon tryall; who liked him very well,
but Mr. Hooke quickly perceived[1719] what was to be donne, so, thought
he, 'why cannot I doe this by my selfe and keepe my hundred pounds?' He
also had some instruction in draweing from Mr. Samuel Cowper (prince of
limners of this age); but whether from him before or after Mr. Lilly
quaere?

☞ Quaere when he went to Mr. Busby's, the schoolemaster of Westminster,
at whose howse he was; and he made very much of him. With him he lodged
his C _li._[1720] There he learnd to[1721] play 20 lessons on the
organ. He there in one weeke's time made himselfe master of the first
VI bookes of _Euclid_, to the admiration of Mr. Busby (now S.T.D.), who
introduced him. At schoole here he was very mechanicall, and (amongst
other things) he invented thirty severall wayes of flying, which I have
not only heard him say, but Dr. Wilkins (at Wadham College at that
time), who gave him his _Mathematicall Magique_ which did him a great
kindnes. He was never a King's Scholar, and I have heard Sir Richard
Knight (who was his school-fellow) say that he seldome sawe him in the
schoole.

Anno Domini <1658> (vide A. Wood's _Antiq. Oxon._) he was sent to
Christ Church in Oxford, where he had a chorister's place (in those
dayes when the church musique was putt-downe[1722]), which was a
pretty good maintenance. He was there assistant to Dr. Thomas Willis
in his chymistry; who afterwards recommended him to the honᵇˡᵉ Robert
Boyle, esqre, to be usefull to him in his chymicall operations. Mr.
Hooke then read to him (R. B., esqre) Euclid's Elements, and made him
understand[1723] Des Cartes' Philosophy. He was Master of Arts anno
Domini....

Anno Domini 166<2> Mr. Robert Boyle recommended Mr. Robert Hooke to
be Curator of the Experiments of the Royall Society, wherin he did an
admirable good worke to the Common-wealth of Learning, in recommending
the fittest person in the world to them. Anno <1664> he was chosen
Geometry[1724] Professour at Gresham College[GA]. Anno Domini 166- Sir
John Cutler, knight, gave a Mechanicall lecture, ... pounds per annum,
which he read.

Anno Domini 166<6> the great conflagration of London happened, and then
he was chosen one of the two surveyors[CXXXII.] of the citie of London;
by which he hath gott a great estate. He built Bedlam, the Physitians'
College, Montague-house, the Piller on Fish-street-hill, and Theatre
there; and he is much made use of in designing buildings.

[CXXXII.] <John> Oliver, the glasse-painter, was the other.

He is but of midling stature, something crooked, pale faced, and his
face but little belowe, but his head is lardge; his eie full and
popping, and not quick; a grey eie. He haz a delicate head of haire,
browne, and of an excellent moist curle. He is and ever was very
temperate, and moderate in dyet, etc.

As he is of prodigious inventive head, so is a person of great vertue
and goodnes. Now when I have sayd his inventive faculty is so great,
you cannot imagine his memory to be excellent, for they are like
two bucketts, as one goes up, the other goes downe. He is certainly
the greatest mechanick this day in the world. His head lies much
more to Geometry then to Arithmetique. He is (1680) a batchelour,
and, I beleeve, will never marie. His elder brother left one faire
daughter[GB], which is his heire. In fine (which crownes all) he is a
person of great suavity and goodnesse.

    <In MS. Aubr. 6, fol. 30, 31, is this letter from Aubrey to
    Anthony Wood, enclosing a communication from Hooke.>

                                                      September 15, 1689.

  Mr. Wood!

Mr. Robert Hooke, R.S.S. did in anno 1670, write a discourse, called,
'An Attempt to prove the motion of the Earth,' which he then read to
the Royal Society; but printed it in the beginning of the yeare 1674,
a _strena_[1727] to Sir John Cutler to whom it is dedicated, wherein
he haz delivered the theorie of explaining the coelestial motions
mechanically; his words are these, pag. 27, 28. viz.:--

['In[1728]the _Attempt to prove the motion of the earth_, etc.,
printed 1674, but read to the Royall Society, 1671: pag. 27, line 31--

'I shall only for the present hint that I have in some of my foregoing
observations discovered some new motions even in the Earth it self,
which perhaps were not dreamt of before, which I shall hereafter more
at large describe, when further tryalls have more fully confirmed and
compleated these beginnings. At which time also I shall explaine a
systeme of the world, differing in many particulars from any yet known,
answering in all things to the common rules of mechanicall motions.
This depends upon 3 suppositions; first, that all coelestiall bodys
whatsoever have an attractive or gravitating power towards their own
centers, whereby they attract not only their own parts, and keep them
from flying from them, as we may observe the Earth to doe, but that
they doe also attract all the other coelestial bodys that are within
the sphere of their activity, and consequently that not only the Sun
and the Moon have an influence upon the body and motion of the Earth,
and the Earth upon them, but that Mercury also, Venus, Mars, Saturne,
and Jupiter, by their attractive powers have a considerable influence
upon its motion, as, in the same manner, the corresponding attractive
power of the Earth hath a considerable influence upon every one of
their motions also. The second supposition is this, that all bodys
whatsoever, that are putt into direct and simple motion will soe
continue to move forwards in a straight line, till they are by some
other effectuall powers deflected and bent into a motion describing
a circle, ellipsis, or some other uncompounded curve line. The third
supposition is, that these attractive powers are soe much the more
powerfull in operating, by how much nearer the body wrought upon is
to their own centers. Now what these severall degrees are, I have not
yet experimentally verified.'--_But these degrees and proportions of
the power of attraction in the celestiall bodys and motions, were
communicated to Mr. Newton by R. Hooke, in the yeare 1678, by letters,
as will plainely appear both by the coppys of the said letters, and
the letters of Mr. Newton in answer to them, which are both in the
custody of the said R. H., both which also were read before the Royall
Society at their publique meeting, as appears by the Journall book of
the said Society._--'But it is a notion which if fully prosecuted, as
it ought to be, will mightily assist the astronomer to reduce all the
coelestiall motions to a certaine rule, which I doubt will never be
done true without it. He that understands the natures of the circular
pendulum and circular motion, will easily understand the whole ground
of this principle, and will know where to find direction in nature
for the true stating thereof. This I only hint at present to such as
have ability and opportunity of prosecuting this inquiry, and are not
wanting of industry for observing and calculating, wishing heartily
such may be found, having my self many other things in hand, which I
will first compleat, and therefore cannot soe well attend (to) it. But
this I durst promise the undertaker; that he will find all the great
motions of the world to be influenced by this principle, and that the
true understanding thereof will be the true perfection of Astronomy.']

About 9 or 10 years ago, Mr. Hooke writt to Mr. Isaac Newton, of
Trinity College, Cambridge, to make[CXXXIII.] a demonstration of this
theory, not telling him, at first, the proportion of the gravity to
the distance, nor what was the curv'd line that was thereby made. Mr.
Newton, in his answer to the letter, did expresse that he had not
known[1729] of it; and in his first attempt about it, he calculated
the curve by supposing the attraction to be the same at all distances:
upon which, Mr. Hooke sent, in his next letter, the whole of his
hypothesis, scil. that the gravitation was reciprocall to the square
of the distance, ['which[1730] would make the motion in an ellipsis,
in one of whose foci the sun being placed, the aphelion and perihelion
of the planet would be opposite to each other in the same line, which
is the whole coelestiall theory, concerning which Mr. Newton hath a
demonstration,'] not at all owning he receiv'd the first intimation of
it from Mr. Hooke. Likewise Mr. Newton haz in the same booke printed
some other theories and experiments of Mr. Hooke's, as that about the
oval figure of the earth and sea: without acknowledgeing from whom he
had them, ['though[1730] he had not sent it up with the other parts of
his booke till near a month after the theory was read to the Society by
Mr. Hooke, when it served to help to answer Dr. Wallis his arguments
produced in the Royal Society against it.']

[CXXXIII.] To[1731] make a demonstration of it, telling him the
proportion of the gravity to the distance and the curv'd line that was
thereby made, to witt that it was an ellipsis in one of the foci of
which was the sun and that that gravitation would make the aphelion and
perihelion opposite to each other in the same diameter which is the
whole celestiall theorie of which Mr. Newton haz made a demonstration.

Mr. Wood! This is the greatest discovery in nature that ever was since
the world's creation. It never was so much as hinted by any man before.
I know you will doe him right. I hope you may read his hand. I wish he
had writt plainer, and afforded a little more paper.

  Tuus,
      J. AUBREY.

Before I leave this towne, I will gett of him a catalogue of what he
hath wrote; and as much of his inventions as I can. But they are many
hundreds; he believes not fewer than a thousand. 'Tis such a hard
matter to get people to doe themselves right.


_Notes._

[FZ] Aubrey gives in trick the coat: 'quarterly, argent and sable a
cross between 4 escallops all counterchanged [Hooke].'

[GA] Aubrey used Hooke's rooms in Gresham College as the place to which
he had his letters addressed. E.g. MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 55, is an envelope
addressed:--

'To his much honoured friend John Awbrey, esqre, these present, at Mr.
Hooke's lodgeings in Gresham College, London.'

MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 48, is an envelope addressed--

'For Mr. John Aubrey: leave these at Mr. Hooke's lodging in Gresham

=Charles Hoskyns= (1584-1609).


[1732]Charles Hoskyns was brother to the Serjeant and the Doctor; a
very ingeniose man, who would not have been inferior to either but
killed himself with hard study.


_Note._

Charles Hoskins, of 'Lenwarne' parish, Hereford, was admitted
probationer July 26, 1604, and fellow of New College in 1606; took B.A.
April 13, 1608; and died in 1609.




=John Hoskyns= (1566-1638).


[1733]John Hoskyns[GC], serjeant-at-lawe, was borne at Mounckton in the
parish of <Llanwarne> in the com. of Hereford, Aº Dⁿⁱ <1566> [on[1734]
St. Mark's day].

Mounckton belonged to the priory of Llantony juxta Glocester, where his
ancestors had the office of cupbearer (or 'pocillator') to the prior.
I have heard there was a windowe given by one Hoskyns there, as by the
inscription did appeare.

Whither the serjeant were the eldest brother[1735] or no, I have
forgott; but he had a brother, John[GD], D.D., a learned man, rector
of Ledbury and canon of Hereford, who, I thinke, was eldest, who was
designed to be a scholar, but this John (the serjeant) would not be
quiet, but he must be a scholar too. In those dayes boyes were seldome
taught to read that were not to be of some learned profession. So, upon
his instant importunity, being then ten yeares of age, he learned to
reade, and, at the yeare's end, entred into his Greeke grammar. This I
have heard his sonne, Sir Benet Hoskyns, knight and baronett, severall
times say.

He was of a strong constitution, and had a prodigious memorie. At
... yeares old, he went to Winton schole, where he was the flower of
his time. I remember I have heard that one time he had not made his
exercise (verse) and spake to one of his forme to shew him his, which
he sawe. The schoolmaster presently calles for the exercises, and
Hoskyns told him that he had writ it out but lost it, but he could
repeate it, and repeated the other boye's exercise (I think 12 or 16
verses) only at once reading over. When the boy who really had made
them shewed the master the same, and could not repeate them, he was
whipped for stealing Hoskyns' exercise. I thinke John Owen[GE] and he
were schoole-fellowes. There were many pretty stories of him when a
schooleboy, which I have forgott. I have heard his son say that he was
a yeare at Westminster; and not speeding there, he was sent to Winton.

The Latin verses in the quadrangle at Winton Colledge[GF], at the cocks
where the boyes wash their hands, were of his making, where there is
the picture[1736] of a good servant, with hind's feet, ... head, a
padlock on his lippes, ... The Latin verses describe the properties of
a good servant.

When he came to New College, he was _Terrae filius_; but he was so
bitterly satyricall that he was expelled and putt to his shifts.

He went into Somersetshire and taught a schole for about a yeare at
Ilchester. He compiled there a Greeke lexicon as far as M, which I have
seen. He maried (neer there) a rich widowe, [of Mr. Bourne]; she was a
Moyle of Kent; by whome he had only one sonne and one daughter.

[After[1737] his mariage] he admitted himselfe at the Middle Temple,
London. He wore good cloathes, and kept good company. His excellent
witt gave him letters of commendacion to all ingeniose persons.
At his[1738]first comeing to London he gott acquainted with the
under-secretaries at court, where he was often usefull to them in
writing their Latin letters.

His great witt quickly made him be taken notice of.

Ben: Johnson called him _father_. Sir Benet (bishop Benet[1739]
of Hereford was his godfather) told me that one time desiring Mr.
Johnson to adopt him for his sonne, 'No,' said he, 'I dare not; 'tis
honour enough for me to be your brother: I was your father's sonne,
and 'twas he that polished me.' In shorte, his acquaintance were all
the witts then about the towne; e.g. Sir Walter Raleigh, who was his
fellow-prisoner in the Tower, where he was Sir Walter's _Aristarchus_
to reviewe and polish Sir Walter's stile; John Donne, D.D.; John Owen,
(vide Epigr. 1--

    Hic liber est mundus; homines sunt, Hoskine, versus:
        Invenies paucos hîc ut in orbe bonos;)

<Richard> Martyn, recorder of London; Sir Benjamin Ruddyer, with whom
it was once his fortune to have a quarrell and fought a duell with him
and hurt him in the knee, but they were afterwards friends again; Sir
Henry Wotton, provost of Eaton College; cum multis aliis.

His conversation was exceedingly pleasant, and on the roade he would
make any one good company to him. He was a great master of the Latin
and Greke languages; a great divine. He understood the lawe well, but
worst at that.

He was admitted at the Middle Temple anno ...; called to be a
serjeant at lawe anno <1623> (vide <Sir William Dugdale's> _Origines
Juridiciales_).

His verses on the fart in the Parliament house are printed in some of
the _Drolleries_. He had a booke of poemes, neatly written by one of
his clerkes, bigger then Dr. Donne's poemes, which his sonn Benet lent
to he knowes not who, about 1653, and could never heare of it since.
Mr. Thomas Henshawe haz an excellent Latin copie in rhythme in the
prayse of ale of his.

He was a very strong man and active. He did the pomado in the saddle of
the third horse in his armour (which Sir John Hoskins haz still) before
William, earle of Pembroke. He was about my heighth.

He had a very readie witt, and would make verses on the roade, where
he was the best company in the world. In Sir H. Wotton's _Remaynes_
are verses (dialogue) made on the roade by him and Sir Henry. He made
an antheme (gett it) in English to be sung at Hereford Minster at the
assizes; but Sir Robert Harley (a great Puritan) was much offended at
it. He made the epitaph on <Peter> Woodgate in New College cloysters.
He made the best Latin epitaphs of his time; amongst many others
an excellent one on <Sir Moyle> Finch, this earl of Winchelsey's
grandfather, who haz a noble monument at Eastwell in Kent.

I will now describe his seate at Morhampton (Hereff.), which he bought
of....

[1740]At the gate-house is the picture of the old fellowe that made the
fires, with a block on his back, boytle and wedges and hatchet. By him,
this distich:--

    Gratus ades quisquis descendis, amicus et hospes:
      Non decet hos humiles mensa superba Lares.

By the porch of the howse, on the wall, is the picture in the margent:--

[Illustration: Noverint universi

et douch et gallante

ꝑroviso semꝓ

hec est finalis concordia]

Above it are these verses:--

    Stat coelum, fateor, Copernice; terra movetur;
      Et mutant dominos tecta rotata suos.

In the chapelle, over the altar, are these two Hebrewe words[1741],
viz.:--

                      וְשָֽׁמַעְתָּ֖ וְסָלָֽחְתָּ

and underneath this distich (1 Reg. 8. 30):--

    Hac quicunque orat supplex exoret in aede,
      Nec pereant servis irrita vota tuis.

Here is an organ that was queen Elizabeth's.

In the gallery <is> the picture of his brother (<the> Doctor) in the
pulpit, <of the> serjeant in his robes, the howse, parke, etc.; and
underneath are these verses:--

    Est casa, sunt colles, lateres[1742], vivaria[1743], lymphae,
      Pascua, sylva, Ceres[1744]: si placet, adde preces[1745].

In the garden, the picture of the gardiner, on the wall of the howse,
with his rake, spade, and water-pott in his left hand. By it, this
distich:--

    Pascitur et pascit locus hic, ornatur et ornat:
      Istud opus nondum lapsus amaret Adam.

In the first leafe of his fee-booke he drew the picture of a purse
as in the margent, and wrote [Illustration: καὶ δῶμεν ὁσκινδω.]
underneath, out of Theocritus.

On his picture in the low gallery are writt on his deske these verses,
viz.:--

    Undecies senos exegi strenuus annos,
      Jam veniet nullo mors inopina die;
    Quae dixi, scripsi, gessive negotia, lusus,
      Obruat aeterno pax taciturna sinu.
    Si quid jure petunt homines, respondeat haeres,
      Dissipet ut cineres nulla querela meos.[1746]
    Quodque Deo, decoctor iniquus, debeo, solve,
      Quaeso, Fidejussor, {sanguine}, Christe, {tuo}.
                          { nomine }           {meo}

These verses with a little alteration are sett on his monument.

Under severall venerable and shady oakes in the parke, he had seates
made; and where was a fine purling spring, he did curbe it with stone.

This putts me in mind of Fr. Petrarch's villa in Italie, which is not
long since printed, where were such devises--vide Tomasini _Petrarcha
redivivus_, Lat., Amsterdam, 12mo.

Besides his excellent naturall memorie, he acquired the artificiall way
of memorie.

He wrote his owne life (which his grandsonne Sir John Hoskyns, knight
and baronet, haz), which was to shew that wheras Plutarch, ..., ...,
etc., had wrote the lives of many generalles, etc., grandees, that
he, or an active man might, from a private fortune by his witt and
industrie attained to the dignity of a serjeant-at-lawe--but he should
have said that they must have parts like his too.--This life I cannot
borrowe.

He wrote severall treatises. Amongst others:--

  a booke of style;
  a method of the lawe (imperfect).

His familiar letters were admirable.

He was a close prisoner in the Tower, tempore regis Jacobi, for
speaking too boldly in the Parliament house of the king's profuse
liberality to the Scotts. He made a comparison of a conduit, whereinto
water came, and ran-out afarre-off. 'Now,' said he, 'this pipe reaches
as far as Edinborough.' He was kept a 'close prisoner' there, i.e., his
windowes were boarded up. Through a small chinke he sawe once a crowe,
and another time, a kite; the sight whereof, he sayd, was a great
pleasure to him. He, with much adoe, obtained at length the favour
to have his little son Bennet to be with him; and he then made this
distich, viz.:--

    Parvule dum puer es, nee scis incommoda linguae,
      Vincula da linguae, vel tibi vincla dabit.

Thus Englished by him:--

    My little Ben, whil'st thou art young,
    And know'st not how to rule thy tongue,
    Make it thy slave whil'st thou art free,
    Least it, as mine, imprison thee.

[1747]I have heard that when he came out of the Tower, his crest
(before expressed) was graunted him, viz., 'a lyon's head couped or,
breathing fire.' The serjeant would say jocosely that it was the only
lyon's head in England that tooke tobacco.

Not many moneths before his death (being at the assises or sessions at
Hereford) a massive countrey fellowe trod on his toe, which caused a
gangrene which was the cause of his death. One Mr. Dighton[CXXXIV.] of
Glocester (an experienced chirurgian who had formerly been chirurgian
in the warres in Ireland) was sent for to cure him; but his skill and
care could not save him. His toes were first cutt-off. The minister
of his parish had a clubbe-foote or feete (I think his name was
Hugh). Said he, 'Sir Hugh'--after his toes were cutt off--'I must be
acquainted with your shoemaker.'

[CXXXIV.] Mr. Dighton would oftentimes say that he generally observ'd
in the Irish warres that those men that went to their wenches the day
before the battayle either did dye upon the spott or came under his
handes. _Digitus Dei!_

Sir Robert Pye, attorney of the court of wardes, was his neighbour,
but there was no great goodwill between them--Sir Robert was haughty.
He happened to dye on Christmas day: the newes being brought to the
serjeant, said he 'The devill haz a Christmas pye.'

He was a very strong man, and valiant, and an early riser in the
morning (scil., at four in the morning). He was black-eyed and had
black hayre.

He lies buried under an altar monument on the north side of the choire
of Dowr abbey in Herefordshire.

(In this abbey church of Dowre are two _frustum's_ or remaynders of
mayled and crosse-legged monuments, one sayd to be of a lord Chandois,
th' other, the lord of Ewyas-lacy. A little before I sawe them a mower
had taken one of the armes to whett his syth.)

On his monument is this inscription:--

            Hoc tegitur tumulo totus quem non tegit orbis,
              Hoskinus, humani prodigium ingenii,
            Usque adeo excoluit duo pugnacissima rerum
              Et quae non subeunt numina[1748] pectus idem,
            Pieridum Legumque potens, jucundus honesto
              Mixtus, Liticulans Musa, forense melos,
            Orando causas pariter pariterque canendo,
              Captavit merito clarus utrumque sophos.

              Sic indefessa personuisse chely,
            Sic populos traxisse truces et agrestibus antris
              Exutos homines consociasse lyrâ;
            Sic magni pectus divinum arsisse Platonis,
              Tum, cum deplorans Astera, jura daret;
            Talem credibile est vixisse Solona poëtam
              Et queiscunque datum est et sapere et furere[1751].
            Sed tu, magne, peris, dum lis certatur utrinque,
              Te Astraea suum vultque Thalia suum.
            Haec habitat coelis, sed et haec terrestribus oris,
              Ipse tui judex poneris ante Deos;
            Scilicet in partes se dividit Hoskinus ambo,
              Haec coelo potitur particula, illa solo.

                  { Parentis pii, memoriae ergo,

This epitaph was made by Thomas Bonham, of Essex, esquier.

The serjeant's epitaph on his wife at Bowe church, Heriff.:--

    Hic Benedicta jacet, de qua maledicere nemo
      Cui genus aut virtus vel pia lingua potest:
    Bournii et Hoskinii conjux et prolis utrique
      Mater erat, Moyli filia, serva Dei.

On Mr. Bourne, his sonne-in-lawe[1752], by him:--

    Nobilis innocuos transegit Bournius annos
      Multa legens, callens plurima, pauca loquens.
    Juridicus causis neque se ditavit[1753] agendis
      Non in habendo locans sed moriendo lucrum.

[1754]_Serjeant Hoskins_:--Serviens ad legem; quaere, if <he was> a
knight. His crest (I believe) granted for his bold spirit, and (I
suppose) contrived by himselfe.

    _Amici_ <included> Egremund Thynne.

      Hic jacet Egremundus Rarus,
      Tuendis paradoxis clarus.
      Mortuus est, ut hic apparet:
      At si loqui posset, hoc negaret.

Was wont to say that all those that came to London were either carrion
or crowes.

[1755]<Memorandum>:--Hoskyns--to collect his nonsense discourse, which
is very good.


_Notes._

[GC] Aubrey gives in trick the coat:--'parted per pale gules and azure,
a chevron between 3 lions rampant or [Hoskyns]: the crest is a lion's
head crowned or, vomiting flames.'

[GD] John Hoskins, of 'Mownton' (Monnington on the Wye) in 'Lanwarne'
parish, Hereford, was admitted probationer of New College June 22,
1584, and Fellow 1586. He was expelled in 1591 'propter dicteria
maledica sub persona Terrae filii.' This was the Serjeant-at-Law.

John Hoskins, of 'Mownton in Lanwarne parish,' Hereford, was admitted
probationer of New College, Aug. 24, 1599, and fellow Aug. 24, 1601,
and resigned his fellowship in 1613. He took D.C.L. in 1613. He died in
1631 (buried at Ledbury, on August 9). This was 'the Doctor.'

[GE] John Owen (the 'epigrammatist'), of Armon in Carnarvonshire, was
admitted probationer of New College Oct. 20, 1582, and Fellow March 31,
1584. He resigned his fellowship in 1591.

[GF] Aubrey, writing Oct. 27, 1671, in Wood MS. F. 39, fol. 142, says:--

'At Winton College is the picture of a servant with asses eares and
hind's feet, a lock on mouth, etc., very good hi<er>oglyphick, with a
hexastique in Latin underneath.... It was done by the serjeant when he
went to school there; but now finely painted. It is at the fountain
where the boyes wash their hands.'




=Sir John Hoskyns= (1634-1705).


[1756]Sir John Hoskyns, knight, one of the Masters of the Chancery,

[1757]Gazette de Londres:--Jean Hoskins, esq., honoré du titre de
chevalerie et l'un de maîtres ordinaires de la cancellerie 30 Janvier
1675.


_Note._

[GG] In MS. Aubr. 23, fol. 63, is a letter to Aubrey from Sir John
Hoskyns, dated Nov. 15, 1673, announcing the birth of this son on Nov.
14, 4ʰ 48´ A.M., and asking him to send to H. C., i.e. Henry Coley the
astrologer.




=Charles Howard= (16-- -16--).


[1758]Charles Howard, eldest son of the honourable Charles Howard of
Norfolke, borne 1664 (old style) on a Thursday between 3 and 4 of the
clocke in the morning, the last day of March, London. Obiit May 5th

Elizabeth Teresa Howard borne the 6 of April, being Easter Eve, 22
minutes after 9 of the clock in the evening. Obiit August 12-moneth

=Robert Hues= (1553-1632).


[1759]My cosen Whitney, a parson, quondam Aeneinas., told me that Hues
_de Globis_ was of that house[1760]; which I put downe in the margent
of the Oxford book[1761].

[1762]Mr. Ashmole thinkes that Robert Hues was of Christ Church.
Perhaps he might be of St. Mary Hall too--for so my old cosin Whitney
told me by tradition.

[1763]Hues _de Globis_:--I have heard my old cosen parson Whitney
say--an old fellow of Brasennose (dyed 12 yeares since, aetat. 78 or
9)--(that) he was of St. Mary Hall.




=Edward Hyde=, earl of Clarendon (1608/9-1674).


[1764]Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, Lord Chancellor of England,
was borne at Dinton in com. Wilts., anno Domini 1608, Febr. 16, as
this[1765] earle thinkes. He told me he has his father's life written
by himselfe, but 'tis not fitt so soon to publish it.

[1766]I thinke I told you that this earl of Clarendon told me his
father was writing the history of our late times. He beginns with
king Charles 1st and brought it to the restauration of king Charles
II, when, as he was writing, the penne fell out of his hand: he took
it up again to write: it fell out again. So then he percieved he was
attacqued by death, scilicet, the dead palsey.--They say 'tis very well
donne: but his sonne will not print it.

[1767]I advertised you, in my last, of a booke printed newly by ...
Royston, viz. 'A vindication of Dr. Stillingfleet against Dr. Cressy,
writt by _a person of honour_.' Mr. Royston assures me the earl of
Clarendon is the author.

[1768]The place of the Lord Chancellor Hyde's birth is Dinton, four
miles from Chalke.

[10] In this edition, some notes about some of them have been brought
in from Aubrey's letters, and his 'Collectio Geniturarum.'

[11] Aubrey notes 'Mr. <Edmund> Halley' as the person to ask about
Flamsted.

[12] Aubrey adds the reference 'vide libr. B.': see Macray's
_Bodleian_, p. 366.

[13] The adventures of Captain Thomas Stump in Guiana are recorded in
Aubrey's _Natural History of Wilts._

[14] i.e. the schemes of nativity given at the beginning of many of
the lives in MS. Aubr. 6. MS. Aubr. 23, 'Collectio genituraram,' drawn
up by Aubrey in 1674 to be deposited in the Ashmolean Museum, is an
earlier contribution to the 'supellex.'

[15] In fol. 11ᵛ Aubrey's book-plate is pasted on.

[16] In the top left corner, '1_s._ 4_d._' is written. Possibly the
price of the original paper-book.

[17] 'Much' substituted for 'so well.'

[18] Aubrey cites in the margin:--

    'Utrumque nostrum admirabili modo
    Consentit astrum.

                                         HORAT. lib. 2, ode 17:

                            PERS. _Sat._ v. _v._ 50';

and adds the date in the margin '1665'; but according to Wood, 1667 was
the date of their first acquaintance (Clark's Wood's _Life and Times_,
ii. 116).

[19] Dupl. with 'hid.'

[20] Subst. for 'girle's.'

[21] Matth. Raderi 'novi commentt.' were published in 1602, and later
editions.

[22] Dupl. with 'inventions.'

[23] 'Have been' is scored out.

[24] Subst. for 'things.'

[25] Foll. 47, 48, in the original (foll. 10, 11, as now foliated). The
rest are scraps: fol. 8 is a paper, bearing date 'London, March 12,
1688/9.'

[26] See, e.g. in the life of David Jenkins, from a letter of Aubrey's,
the expressions which brought Wood into court and expelled him from the
University.

[27] Fol. 2, in the present marking.

[28] I have little doubt that the substance of all the missing pages is
incorporated into the _Athenae_: cf., e.g. William Penn's life here by
Aubrey, and the notice of Penn in Wood's _Athenae_.

[29] Aubrey quotes in the margin:--ἔπεα πτερόεντα.--HOM.

[30] Dated 'July 1ᵐᵒ, 1681'--MS. Aubr. 8, fol. 5. In this index the
names of some persons occur for notice, of whom no account is found
here or elsewhere:--e.g. '... Aldsworth; Richard Blackbourne, M.D.; Sir
George Etheridge; Isaac Newton.'

[31] There are now several inserted papers and slips. The two last
leaves of the MS. as now made up (foll. 104, 105), belong to neither
section of it, but have been brought in from elsewhere, possibly from
loose Rawlinson papers.

[32] Anthony Wood has marked it as 'G. 10' of his _Athenae_ Collections
(see Clark's Wood's _Life and Times_, iv. 232), thus showing that he
looked on it as his own property.

[33] In this index or on blank pages in the treatise, some are
mentioned for their lives to be written, of whom no account is found
here or elsewhere in the biographical collections:--e.g. Mr. <Thomas>
Blundeville; <Henry> Bond; Mr. Robert Hues; Mr. <Thomas> Lidyate; Mr.
... Phale <i.e. Thomas Fale>; Edmund Wingate.

[34] 'For' subst. for 'in order to the writing.'

[37] 'These following' subst. for 'my.'

[38] Aubrey queries 'Is John Escuidus mentioned among them?'

[39] Lond. 1616.

[40] Written at first 'Venit et Hobbi.'

[41] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 29. Aubrey notes in the margin:--'The ὕλη of the
preface to the life written by Mr. H. him selfe in <the> third person';
intending I suppose to consult it in remodelling his own draft preface.

[42] Subst. for 'now.'

[43] Subst. for 'setting forth.'

[44] Subst. for 'honoured.'

[45] Dupl. with 'pueritia mea.'

[46] Dupl. with 'having both the same schoolmaster.'

[47] Dupl. with 'desired.'

[48] See in the life of Selden.

[49] In a marginal note Aubrey remarks 'meliorate this word.' Another
note is 'Quaere of the preface of this Supplement,' i.e., I suppose,
ask some one's opinion whether it will do or not.

[50] Dupl. with 'will <be>.'

[51] Dupl. with 'slipt.'

[52] Dupl. with 'đđ' i.e. dedicate.

[53] Subst. for 'But for that the _recrementa_ of such a person are
valueable. It is with matters of antiquity as with the sett....'

[54] Subst. for 'good light.'

[55] Dupl. with 'so many degrees, etc.'

[56] Dupl. with 'entring.'

excisions in Wood's notice of Hobbes in his _Hist. et Antiq. Univ.
Oxon._, 1674, see Clark's Wood's _Life and Times_, ii. 291.

[70] MS. has '1688,' by a slip.

[71] Dupl. with 'sketches.'

[72] Anthony Wood has jotted here ''Tis well.'

[73] Aubrey's letter, dated June 1, 1693, is found in MS. Tanner 25,
fol. 59.

[74] Malone's note in Mr. Doble's MS.

[75] I have shown this as regards the text of Anthony Wood's _Life_;
and I hope some day to show it in the much more important matter of the
text of the _Athenae_.

[159] 'Dew' is subst. for 'and sp<irit>.'

[160] i.e. my character throughout my life was that I discharged the

matters and so rescued them from oblivion.

[162] The people he set to work.

[177] The paragraphs following repeat, with some enlargement, the

[178] Dupl. with 'till all was sold.'

[179] Dupl. with 'great.'

[1222] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 30.

[1223] Dupl. with 'vicar.' Anthony Wood wrote in the margin 'vicar of
Malmsbury,' but scored it out, as in error.

[1224] Wood wished to add 'or Sir Rogers.'

[1225] Dupl. with 'did.'

[1226] Dupl. with 'valued not.'

[1227] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 29ᵛ.

[1228] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 30.

[1229] i.e. Thomas, the father.

[1230] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 31.

[1231] Dupl. with 'pasture.' In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 28, Aubrey calls it
'a good moweing ground, called Gaston, not far from the house he <T.
H.> was borne in.'

[1232] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 30ᵛ.

[1233] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 31.

[1234] Dupl. with 'with,' i.e. with his uncle, as well as to his trade.

[1235] Dupl. with 'about.'

[1236] Dupl. with 'face.'

[1237] In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 28, Aubrey says, 'He <T.H.> had an elder
brother, named Edmund Hobbes, more then once alderman of Malmesbury':
but this is probably an error, from confusing him with the uncle.

[1238] Dupl. with 'parts.'

[1239] i.e. William Aubrey.

[1240] Dupl. with 'boy'

[1241] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 32.

[1242] Dupl. with 'pourtraying.'

[1243] Other drawings of Malmsbury by Aubrey are in MS. Aubr. 3, fol.
35 and 39.

[1244] On this Anthony Wood comments:--'I think 'tis fit it should be
drawne and represented, for the abbey sake. 'Tis cheap to have cut in
box.'

[1245] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 32.

[1246] scil. of the 'neck of land.'

[1247] Dupl. with 'melted.'

[1248] Dupl. with 'adorned.'

[1249] Dupl. with 'and.'

[1250] Anthony Wood notes here 'as it was concerning Homer.'

[1251] Dupl. with 'as I say.'

[1252] Dupl. with 'enjoyed.'

[1253] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 33.

[1254] Dupl. with 'with.'

[1255] See _infra_, p. 388.

[1256] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 32ᵛ.

[1257] Quoted from Hobbes' metrical life of himself.

[1258] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 33.

[1259] Dupl. with 'proves.'

[1260] Aubrey notes opposite this sentence:--'This is good.'

[1261] Dupl. with 'and then.' Subst. for 'at eight yeares of age he
could.'

[1262] Written at first 'Three Tunnes (quaere William Aubrey)': and
then changed when W. A. answered the query.

[1263] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 34.

[1264] Dupl. with '25 +.'

[1265] Dupl. with 'the oven' <dupl. with 'pies'> 'had devoured them.'

[1266] Dupl. with 'the boyes.'

[1267] Dupl. with 'strings.'

[1268] Dupl. with 'draw through.'

[1269] Anthony Wood corrects to 'the stationers' shops.'

[1270] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 35.

[1271] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 34ᵛ.

[1272] This paragraph is an insertion by Anthony Wood in answer to
Aubrey's query.

[1273] His name is not entered in the University matriculation-register.

[1274] Part of the formula of admission: Clark's _Reg. Univ. Oxon._ II.
i. 48.

[1275] 1607/8; _ibid._ II. iii. 278.

[1276] _ibid._ II. i. 50.

[1278] Subst. for 'Mr. John Wilkinson.'

[1279] Dupl. with 'did believe.'

[1280] Dupl. with 'then.'

[1281] Dupl. with 'was.'

[1282] Dupl. with 'notions.'

[1283] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 36.

[1284] The chronology is here difficult. William Cavendish, second earl
of Devonshire, died 20 June, 1628; and it is he whom Hobbes regarded as
his 'first' lord (see his inscription, _infra_, p. 386), not his father
William, first earl, who died 3 March, 1625/6. Bacon died 9 Apr. 1626.

[1285] Subst. for 'time.'

[1286] In the first attempt at this paragraph Aubrey wrote, 'T. H. came
into his native country. I was then a little youth and went to schoole
to Mr. Robert Latimer at Leigh-de-la-mere in the church about a mile
from my father's house (Easton Pierse).'

[1287] In a second attempt it stood '... at Leigh-de-la-mere. I was
then a little youth newly entred into my grammar by him, and we went to
schoole in the church.'

[1288] Dupl. with 'came to.'

[1289] Dupl. with 'friends.'

[1290] Dupl. with 'equipage.'

[1291] Here followed 'and moist-curled,' dupl. with 'and with moist
curles'; but both struck out.

[1292] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 35ᵛ.

[1293] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 36.

[1294] Anthony Wood writes here 'do not you mean 40?' Aubrey had
written '4' by a pen-slip; afterwards he corrected it.

[1295] 'Element' used for 'proposition.'

[1296] Subst. for 'He would now and then use an emphaticall oath.'

[1297] Dupl. with 'curious witt.'

[1298] 'Began it early' is written over, in explanation.

[1299] Dupl. with 'to the witts.'

[1300] Dupl. with 'then doe well.'

[1311] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 37.

[1312] Anthony Wood notes 'Roger Manneringe.'

[1313] Dupl. with 'went.'

[1321] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 38.

[1322] Subst. for 'of Euclid and Vitellio.'

[1323] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 39.

[1324] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 37ᵛ.

[1325] i.e. fol. 50ᵛ of the MS., where is a note by Anthony Wood, as
given _infra_, p. 367.

[1326] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 39.

[1327] Subst. for 'which came out anno ...' Anthony Wood notes, 'Vide
catalogue of <Hobbes's> books in _Hist. <et Antiq. Univ.> Oxon._, and
vide transcript thence.'--MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 38ᵛ.

[1328] 'his _Dialogi_' followed: scored out.

[1329] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 40.

[1330] 'a yeare +' followed: scored out.

[1331] Dupl. with 'an ill.'

[1332] In MS. Aubr. 3, fol. 28, Aubrey says that Thomas Hobbes gave it
to 'his elder brother, named Edmund Hobbes.'

[1333] Dupl. with 'in Derbyshire.'

[1334] Dupl. with 'good.'

[1335] Dupl. with 'want.'

[1336] Subst. for 'thought.'

[1337] Aubrey notes opposite this: 'better this expression.'

[1338] Dupl. with 'designe.'

[1339] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 42. On fol. 41ᵛ Aubrey makes this apology
for its coming there out of due order of time:--'Give notice how
things are to be right placed, for all things comes not into my memory
chronologically and this seemes almost necessary to be forced.'

[1340] Dupl. with 'way.'

[1341] Subst. for 'researching and contemplating one thing, then of
another; but he had a method for it.'

[1342] Dupl. with 'proviso' or 'observation.'

[1343] _Infra_, p. 382.

[1344] Dupl. with 'such a poeme.'

[1345] Sir John Vaughan, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, 1668-1674.

[1346] Dupl. with 'great.'

[1347] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 7--'quaere bishop Sarum when he was motioned
to be burnt.' _Ibid._, fol. 7ᵛ, 'Quaere bp. Sarum <Seth Ward> who and
when (annum) the motion in parliament was to have Mr. Hobbes burnt.'

[1348] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 40.

[1349] Subst. for '1660. The winter before (of 1659) he spent his time
in Derbyshire.'

[1350] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 39ᵛ.

[1351] Dupl. with 'good newes.'

[1352] Dupl. with 'hearing.'

[1353] Dupl. with 'opportunity.'

[1355] Aubrey writes opposite on fol. 40ᵛ:--'_embouche_, such word in
English?'

[1356] MS. has 'and,' by a slip for 'at.'

[1357] Dupl. with 'enterteyned.'

[1358] Dupl. with 'facetiae.'

[1359] Dupl. with 'the witts.'

[1360] Aubrey wishes to limit the readiness in reply to cases of light
badinage: in serious subjects Hobbes was slow and deliberate.

[1361] Dupl. with 'good.'

[1362] Dupl. with 'a present answer.'

[1363] Dupl. with 'mathematicall.'

[1364] i.e. see further about this on fol. 45ᵛ of the MS., the note
found _infra_, p. 356.

[1365] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 42.

[1366] Subst. for 'he last left London, he was often in London at his
lord's.'

[1367] Dupl. with 'penned': see _infra_, p. 351.

[1374] Dupl. with 'attempt.'

[1375] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 42ᵛ.

[1376] Dupl. with 'I. A.'

[1377] Subst. for 'sayes.'

[1387] Dupl. with 'but queen Katharine.'

[1388] Dupl. with 'hating him.'

[1389] Dupl. with 'prevented.'

[1390] '1674' is struck out and 1669/1670 substituted for it--this
latter being the date of Wood's altercations with Dr. Fell. 1674 was
the date of publication: see _infra_.

[1391] Anthony Wood struck out the passage enclosed in square brackets,
and sent Aubrey a more elaborate account (now fol. 48, 48ᵛ of MS. Aubr.
9) to take its place. This is printed in Clark's Wood's _Life and
Times_, ii. 291, 292; and is perhaps the paper which Wood blames Aubrey
for having kept, _ibid._ ii. 475, 476.

[1392] Aubrey added, in the margin, the correction 'A. W. sayes but
ten.'

[1393] Dupl. with 'the absolute.'

[1394] Wood adds 'and after.'

[1395] Dupl. with 'his great griefe, expunged and inserted what he
thought fitt.'

[1396] Corrected by Wood to '376, 377.' The mistake is made in Hobbes's
printed epistle, and Aubrey copied it thence.

[1397] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 45.

[1398] Corrected by Wood to 'without the advice and quite contrary to
the mind of the author.'

[1399] Corrected by Wood to 'know what he had done.'

[1400] Note on fol. 43ᵛ of MS. Aubr. 9. 'Page 15' in Aubrey's numbering
is now fol. 45 of the MS.

[1401] Wood adds 'in the beginning of 1674.'

[1402] i.e. John Aubrey.

[1403] Wood adds 'and to let him see that he would do nothing underhand
against him.'

[1404] Wood adds 'that he had sent to Mr. Wood.' See Clark's Wood's
_Life and Times_, ii. 288.

[1405] Wood adds 'at it as a most famous libell.'

[1406] Corrected by Wood to 'and, soon after, meeting with the author.'

[1407] Wood adds 'and that he would have the printer called to account
for printing such a notorious libell.'

[1408] The advance-copies of Wood's _Hist. et Antiq. Univ. Oxon._ were
issued July 17, 1674 (Wood's _Life and Times_, ii. 289); the ordinary
issue took place on July 27 (_ibid._, 290), being perhaps delayed for
the insertion of the rejoinder to Hobbes; Hobbes's epistle had been
circulated on July 11 (_ibid._, p. 288).

[1409] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 46.

[1410] Aubrey inserts a copy as fol. 44 of MS. Aubr. 9.

[1411] See it in Wood's _Hist. et Antiq._ at the end.

[1412] Dupl. with 'scurrilous.'

[1447] MS. Aubr. 9, fol 45ᵛ.

[1448] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 46ᵛ.

[1449] As an alternative Aubrey suggests:--'As he had an harmonicall
soule, so consequently he was no woman-hater (misogynist).' But he adds
the criticism that this sentence is 'perhaps too affected.'

[1450] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 47.

[1451] Subst. for 'that he haz been drunke in his life.'

[1452] Dupl. with 'long.'

[1471] Anthony Wood notes, on fol. 47ᵛ, 'he used to take the sacrament,
and acknowledge a supreeme being.'

[1472] Here Aubrey intended (see _infra_) to cite evidence as to
Hobbes's religious opinions.

[1473] Dupl. with 'give it the lye.'

[1474] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 47ᵛ.

[1475] i.e. it was to Aubrey himself that Hobbes expressed this opinion.

[1476] MS. Aubr. 9, fol. 45ᵛ.

been 'already mentioned.'
